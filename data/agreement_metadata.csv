It acts as the collective bargaining agreement for SAG-AFTRA Performers and Background Actors on these projects, outlining eligibility, excluded productions, compensation terms (negotiated pay, deferred pay, overtime, pension/health), limited exhibition rights (festivals, free new media, awards, industry showcases, public access TV), worktime, and non-waivable payments. Projects exceeding limits or failing disclosures may be reclassified."

To qualify, the project must have a total budget of $20,000 or less, be shot in the U.S., be a live-action entertainment project intended for free-to-the-consumer release via limited 'Permitted Uses' (film festivals, free new media, industry showcases, limited public access TV, classroom use, Academy consideration). It explicitly excludes commercials, music videos, corporate videos, and content with nudity, simulated sex, or hazardous conditions/stunts. The agreement requires the Producer to recognize SAG-AFTRA, inform performers, and obtain a specific acknowledgment form. A key provision states that if the project is misrepresented or distributed outside the permitted uses, SAG-AFTRA may reclassify it to a different agreement, requiring the Producer to pay any difference in compensation and benefits retroactively. Disputes are generally handled via arbitration."
