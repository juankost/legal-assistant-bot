| over 90 to 120 min. | 1,424 | 1,460 | 1,504 | 1,549 | 36 |

All other terms and conditions set forth in Paragraph 5.A. and 5.C. pertaining to programs of the above lengths are applicable and, except as modified in Paragraph 53, all other provisions of this Code apply.
(4) On all Additional Rehearsal Days worked or credited, the Minimum Session and Minimum Daily Call shall be six (6) hours; provided, however, that a meal period of not more than two (2) hours may be given without breaking the session.

In those instances where a Producer or his/her representative is aware at the time dancers are being offered employment that work in excess of six (6) consecutive days may be necessary, the Producer will so inform the dancers prior to engagement of their services.

If there have been recurring cases of scheduling dancers for an excessive number of consecutive days of work, the matter may be referred to the jointSAG-AFTRA-Producers Special Committee in an effort to find a mutually acceptable solution to the problem.
(5) For definitions and conditions applicable to rehearsal hours and days, including guaranteed days of employment, see Paragraphs 13-20, except that for dancers who dance, a rehearsal day in a rehearsal hall shall consist of no more than six (6) out of seven (7) consecutive hours, inclusive of meal periods.
(6) No principal performer (as defined in par. 2.B.(1)) or member of a specialty act shall be considered as a member of a dancers' group in determining the appropriate group rate.
(7) Any member of a dancing group who steps out and performs as a soloist or as part of a duo for eight (8) or more consecutive bars shall be paid additional compensation (a step out fee) at the following rates:

| Program Length | Rate Effective <br> $\mathbf{1 1 / 1 7 / 1 3}$ | Rate Effective <br> $\mathbf{1 1 / 1 6 / 1 4}$ | Rate Effective <br> $\mathbf{1 1 / 1 6 / 1 5}$ | Rate Effective <br> $\mathbf{1 1 / 1 6 / 1 5}$ |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 30 Minute Program | 85 | 87 | 90 | 93 |
| 60 Minutes or Longer Program | 162 | 166 | 171 | 176 |

except that any such dancer who steps out and so performs for sixteen (16) or more consecutive bars shall be paid the full principal performer's fee if the amount of such fee is greater than the total of the full group dancer fee including the step out fee as provided above; and any member of a dancing group who steps out and performs as a member of a smaller group for sixteen (16) or more consecutive bars shall be paid the smaller group rate. Such reclassifications shall not operate to reduce the size of the overall group with respect to fees payable to the remainder of the group.
(8) In no event shall any dancer be asked or assigned to rehearse on unsafe floors, or concrete, cement, stone or similar surfaces unless the surface is covered in such a manner as to result in a resilient dancing surface except on "camera day" when the requirements of other broadcasting equipment make use of such non-resilient surfaces unavoidable.

Dancing on wet or oily surfaces will be considered hazardous for purposes of Paragraph 5.A.(12).
(9) Dancers doing knee work, including rolling, spinning, falling, balancing, hinging, walking, turning, and/or performing a choreographed routine on the knees, will be permitted to wear knee pads where practicable in rehearsal and performance.
(10) During the 1982 and 1985 negotiations, AFTRA claimed that hazards would be created for dancers who are required to wear masks during dance routines or are required to dance under conditions which may impair sight or breathing (e.g., fog, smoke, fire). The Producers acknowledged that the wearing of a mask may impair visibility, and that there could be situations in which the nature of the mask combined with the requirements of particular choreography would entitle a dancer to the hazard pay required by Paragraph 5.A.(12) of the TV Network Code. The Producers further acknowledged that, under certain circumstances, dancing under conditions which impair sight or breathing (e.g., fog, smoke, fire), when combined with the requirements of particular choreography also shall entitle a dancer to such hazard pay. This provision will be brought to the attention of the SAG-AFTRA-Producers Special Committee provided in Paragraph 5.A.(12) and may be cited in any special arbitration proceeding brought under that paragraph.(11) Compensation for group dancers who are required by the Producer to sing or lip sync (i.e., synchronization of lip movements with lyrics) shall be computed in accordance with the applicable rules stated in Paragraph 46 (Doubling). The applicable basic dancers minimum program fee shall be utilized as the base in computing any replay payments and any payments for telecasts in foreign areas which may be due such group dancers.
(12) For performing a hazardous dance routine or other hazardous activity (such as wire flying) in a studio or on location, dancers will be paid $\$ 100.00$ for each such day, provided that the minimum payment per program shall be not less than $\$ 125.00$ as provided in Paragraph 39.A. In recognition of unique problems in determining the entitlement of dancers to such additional compensation for hazardous activity, the following procedures will be applicable. If a dancer believes that a dance routine or other activity that the dancer is requested to perform should entitle the dancer to such additional compensation, the matter will be discussed promptly between the SAG-AFTRA representative assigned to the program and the Producer or the Producer's designated representative. If the matter cannot be resolved by that on-the-spot discussion, the SAG-AFTRA representative will prepare a written description of the specific dance routine or other activity, and other facts pertinent to the claim, which will be confirmed and initialed by the Producer and filed with the local SAG-AFTRA Executive Director.

When a number of such claims have been filed, but not less frequently than once each quarter if any claims are on file, the Executive Director will convene a meeting of the SAG-AFTRA-Producers Special Committee. There shall be two (2) Special Committees, one (1) in New York City and one (1) in Los Angeles, each consisting of two (2) dancer representatives and two (2) representatives of the Producers.

The Committee will review the pending claims and attempt to resolve them. All such resolutions will be based on the specific circumstances involved and will be on a no-precedent basis. If a claim is upheld, the Producer will be notified in writing and must make the required payment to the dancer (by check mailed to the SAG-AFTRA Executive Director) within five (5) working days of receipt of the notice to do so. Two (2) panels of arbitrators, each of which is to consist of ten (10) named arbitrators agreed to by the parties, shall be maintained and filed with the American Arbitration Association, one (1) in New York City and one (1) in Los Angeles. Names may be added or deleted from time to time by mutual agreement. Whenever either Special Committee has at least four (4) pending claims which it has been unable to resolve, either SAG-AFTRA or the Producer may submit such claims for arbitration under Paragraph 95, with the following special rules being applicable:
(a) There will be a single arbitrator selected from the appropriate panel.
(b) The matter will be presented to the arbitrator by a representative of the Producer and by a representative of SAG-AFTRA.
(c) The arbitrator will render an award either granting or denying each claim, with no written opinion.
(d) The arbitrator's award will be on a no-precedent basis and not citable in any subsequent arbitration proceeding.
(13) Subject to applicable law, if a dancer on whose behalf contributions have been made to the AFTRA Health and Retirement Funds during five (5) of the prior ten (10) years is employed to work on a covered television program as an assistant choreographer, but not as a dancer or in any other category covered by the Code, Producer will contribute to the AFTRA Health andRetirement Funds on such dancer's behalf on the basis of the highest compensation received by any group dancer on the program for services as a group dancer. If no individual classified as a dancer under this Code appears on the program, the contribution shall be based on the Group Dancer program fee, pursuant to the length of the program. Such employment shall not be subject to other provisions of the Code.

If a dancer who has qualified for health coverage under the AFTRA Health and Retirement Funds for five (5) years is employed to work on a covered television program as a choreographer, but not as a dancer or in any other category covered by the Code, Producer will contribute to the AFTRA Health and Retirement Funds on such dancer's behalf on the basis of the highest compensation received by any group dancer on the program for services as a group dancer. If no individual classified as a dancer under this Code appears on the program, the contribution shall be based on the Group Dancer program fee, pursuant to the length of the program. ${ }^{1}$ This paragraph shall not require the application of any other provision of the Code to choreographers.
(14) For non-syndicated non-prime time programs, Producer shall have the option of employing group dancers in accordance with this Subparagraph (14) in lieu of the provisions of Subparagraphs (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) above:

# 16. REST BETWEEN DAYS 

A. There shall be a rest period of not less than twelve (12) hours between the end of work on one (1) rehearsal day and the beginning of work on the next rehearsal day, provided that if any performer is required by the Producer to report to work within such twelve (12) hour period, he shall be paid $\$ 20.00$ per hour for the hours between the time he is required to and does report, and the end of such twelve (12) hour period, in addition to the applicable extra rehearsal rate. Such hours shall not be credited against the hours of rehearsal which are included in the minimum rates hereunder.
B. Serials:

In recognition of the special problems of serial principal performers who appear in successive daily episodes and who under such circumstances have unique problems in memorizing lines and otherwise preparing for such successive episodes:
(1) The amounts payable under this Paragraph 16 where applicable shall be multiplied by five (5) for the first two (2) hours and shall be multiplied by six (6) for each additional hour in the case of a serial performer who must memorize lines. Such amounts shall be paid in minimum increments of one (1) hour.
(2) In order to address the major concern that continuous invasions of rest period combined with excessive work hours may adversely affect such a performer's health and career, the parties have further agreed to the following special provision:
(a) In the event it appears that such performer's rest period may be invaded for a second consecutive time in a workweek, he/she may request to be rescheduled so that the invasion of his/her rest period(s) will be eliminated or reduced.
(b) In considering such request, Producer will take into account such concerns and factors as the human needs of the performer, the prior and upcoming schedule of the performer, the impact on others of granting such request, the availability and viability of alternative production methods (e.g., stand-ins), all in context of the needs and budget of the enterprise. If in order to grant such request or to otherwise reduce or eliminate rest period invasions Producer reschedules any rehearsal, the provisions of Paragraph 55.A. shall not apply.
(c) Given the gravity of these matters it is the expectation of the parties that performers will not make such requests lightly nor routinely, and that Producer will give good faith consideration to each request. Producer will record all responses to such requests when made in writing and will make such information available to SAG-AFTRA before any meeting of the Serials Forum. A claim by either party that these expectations are not being lived up to may be presented for consideration at the next Serials Forum.
(d) If a performer is required to work for at least one (1) hour of the applicable rest period on two (2) consecutive occasions in a workweek, a penalty of $\$ 105.00$ per hour shall be paid for those hours worked during the second or any subsequent rest period in lieu of the payments otherwise due under (1) above. If the total time worked during such rest periods is four (4) hours or more, theProducer shall pay an additional lump sum penalty of $\$ 325.00$ for the second such rest period invasion.
(e) Producer may not invade the third consecutive rest period in a workweek of any performer who qualifies for the $\$ 105.00$ per hour penalty provided for above and whose total time worked during such rest periods is four (4) hours or more, unless Producer pays $\$ 105.00$ per hour for all hours of rest period invasion for which a $\$ 105.00$ penalty is not already required by Paragraph B.(2)(d) and a lump sum penalty of $\$ 350.00$ to performer for such third invasion.
(f) Producer may not invade the fourth or subsequent consecutive rest period in a workweek of any performer who qualifies for the $\$ 105.00$ per hour penalty provided for in Paragraph B.(2)(d) above and whose total time worked during such rest periods is four (4) hours or more, unless Producer pays $\$ 105.00$ per hour for all hours of rest period invasion for which a $\$ 105.00$ penalty is not already required by Paragraph B.(2)(d) and a lump sum penalty of $\$ 400.00$ to performer for each such fourth or subsequent invasion.
(g) For purposes of this Paragraph (2), on overnight remote locations the applicable rest period shall be eleven (11) hours, but all other provisions in this Paragraph 16 B. shall apply.
(h) For purposes of avoiding disputes over the facts involved in the application of this Paragraph (2) the Producer shall establish a sign in/sign out procedure for the principal performers on each serial.
C. The Producer agrees to make a good faith attempt to provide adequate rest between work days.

# 17. MINIMUM DAILY CALL (NOT APPLICABLE TO SERIALS)

C. A performer shall be given credit or payment for no less than a minimum call for the number of days guaranteed employment within each unit of the Guarantee Period, as set forth in Paragraph 19, whether worked or not.
D. When the number of included rehearsal hours is not evenly divisible by the number of hours in the minimum daily call, the balance may be used on any of the performer's Included Rehearsal Days as a separate session, which may be less than the number of hours in the minimum call, but not less than one (1) hour in length. The minimum daily call for each category of performer is specified in Paragraphs 2-8. For special provisions applicable to strip programs (other than serials), see Paragraph 20.

## 18. MINIMUM SESSION (NOT APPLICABLE TO SERIALS)

Rehearsal time beyond the minimum session shall be computed in half-hour ( $1 / 2$ ) segments for each half-hour ( $1 / 2$ ) or part thereof. For special provisions applicable to strip programs (other than serials), see Paragraph 20.A. When a performer's first rehearsal day is scheduled prior to his period of Included Rehearsal Days he shall be entitled to guaranteed days of employment as hereinafter provided in this paragraph.
B. The Guarantee Period is that period of time beginning with a performer's first scheduled day of rehearsal and ending with the day just prior to his first Included Rehearsal Day. The Producer guarantees that during the Guaranteed Period the performer shall be given the applicable credit or payment for no less than a minimum daily call, whether worked or not, for the number of days of guaranteed employment within each unit as specified in the following schedule:

| Number of Guaranteed <br> Days of Employment | Number of Consecutive Days <br> in Guarantee Period (Unit) |

| 5 | 7 |
| 4 | 6 |
| 3 | 5 |
| 3 | 4 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 1 | 2 |
| 1 | 1 |

If the Guarantee Period is longer than seven (7) days, the guarantee shall be computed in successive seven (7) day units, commencing with the performer's first scheduled day of rehearsal, except that the last unit (i.e., the one immediately preceding the Included Rehearsal Days) may be fewer than seven (7) days. If the last unit has fewer than seven (7) days, the guarantee for such unit shall be computed in accordance with the above schedule and based upon the number of days in the last unit.
C. When a performer's Guarantee Period begins more than fourteen (14) days prior to his scheduled final performance day, Producer shall pay the sum of $\$ 50.00$ per week as an advance which shall be credited against the performer's total fee, and such payment shall be made not later than Thursday of each week during the period prior to the week in which the final performance day is scheduled.
D. Where a segment is recorded prior to the principal production of the program and where a performer in the segment is also employed in the principal production of the program, the Producer may, in lieu of the above provisions, pay the performer compensation for the segment at the applicable overtime extra rehearsal rate, with a minimum of four (4) hours (which compensation shall be in addition to the applicable minimum compensation to which he is entitled for other services on the program). In no event, however, shall payment under this subparagraph D be less than ninety dollars ( $\$ 90.00$ ) for group singers and dancers, or less than one hundred and eighty dollars ( $\$ 180.00$ ) for principal performers. Producer may not require a performer to appear in such segment at a time which conflicts with the bona fide prior commitments of the performer.

Except when the segment is done at the time of one show for another in the series, or except where the performer is under a term contract for the series, Producer must inform performer at the time of employment that he will be utilized in segments some time prior to the principal production. Group Singers and Dancers may not record a segment under this clause except while working on another program in the same series.The provisions of Paragraphs 13-19 apply to performers in strip programs (other than serials) with the following modifications:

C. Included Rehearsal Days:

The period of Included Rehearsal Days may be split (i.e., such days need not be consecutive) when a Saturday, Sunday or holiday which is not worked intervenes between successive Included Rehearsal Days which are worked, or for which the performer is given the applicable credit or payment, whether for the show of the day worked or for a different show in the series. When such split occurs, no minimum call shall be applicable to such Saturday, Sunday or holiday which is not worked; but, in such case, a performer shall be given the applicable credit or payment for no less than a minimum call (subject to the exception provided in subparagraph A above) for the day immediately preceding and the day immediately following the intervening day or days not worked.
D. Guaranteed Days of Employment:

The provisions of Paragraph 19 shall not apply to performers in running parts on strip programs, nor shall the provisions of Paragraph 19 apply to any other performer on a strip program when, in addition to his services on any day on one (1) program, he also pre-records on that day a portion of his performance for use on another program of the same series on which he is otherwise performing; provided, however, that such performer shall be paid for a minimum of four (4) hours at the applicable extra rehearsal rate as a result of such pre-recording of a portion of his performance on such other program, which amount may not be credited towards the applicable minimum compensation for his performance on such other program. Such provisions shall apply to all other performers, except that the Guarantee Period shall not be commenced when such performer is required to rehearse or to pre-record a portion of a program prior to his scheduled final performance day for that program because of Producer's call to rehearse or record on a day(s) which is outside the normal rehearsal period for that program to meet the convenience or to avoid conflicts or prior commitments of any performer in the cast.
E. Special Provisions:

On strip programs of over forty-five (45) to sixty (60) minutes, the included rehearsal hours for principal performers are ten (10) hours, except for new programs (including programs increasing program length to over forty-five (45) to sixty (60) minutes).

The performer's reading session shall be held within the period of a Regular or Included Rehearsal Days, as defined in Paragraph 13 of this Code, or within two (2) days prior to the start of his or any other performer's first rehearsal day and such reading session shall be paid for at the applicable rehearsal rate. In no case shall the reading session start the employment Guarantee Period as defined in Paragraph 19 of this Code.
B. Serials:

If a performer otherwise works on a day on which the performer participates in a reading session, the hours of the reading session shall be treated as time worked.

D. A person qualified under the circumstances to administer medical assistance on an emergency basis shall be present or readily available at all rehearsals and all performances during which hazardous actions or work under hazardous conditions is planned. In the event Producer does not have such qualified person present or readily available, the performer(s) concerned or SAG-AFTRA may request that such a person be present or readily available, which request may not be unreasonably denied. SAG-AFTRA or the performer(s) may likewise request in certain situations that said qualified person be present and not merely readily available. Any such person will have visible identification.

If a performer is not notified, the performer may refuse to perform in smoke or hazardous substances and will nevertheless be paid a program fee or his/her guarantee, whichever is greater. However, the above sentence shall not be construed to give the performer the right to refuse other work that day which does not involve smoke or hazardous substances, nor to mean that a performer is entitled to more than one (1) program fee or guarantee for any one (1) day's work. (Paragraph 39, section A. may also apply.)
B. Producer shall comply with all Federal and State laws and regulations applicable to the use of substances utilized for the creation of smoke and other effects and the Industry shall cooperate with SAG-AFTRA to the end that information concerning such Federal and State laws and regulations is disseminated.

If the contract is an original agreement for a term of two (2) years or more, any portion of the term extending beyond the initial twelve (12) months must, if cyclical, be in cycles of at least twenty-six (26) weeks; provided that either the first or second cycle of any such contract may be adjusted in order to synchronize the performer's contract cycles with those of other performers on the same program. Ifthis adjusted cycle is less than eight (8) weeks in length, it shall not count for the purpose of determining the period after which new cycles must be at least twentysix (26) weeks; if such adjusted cycle is eight (8) or more weeks in length, it shall be counted for such purpose.

The Producer must specify in the original agreement which cycle, if any, will be adjusted and the specific time period of such adjusted cycle.
B. If the contract is a renewal agreement (i.e., for a term beginning at the end of an earlier term which was not subject to extension or renewal except by mutual agreement) for a term of eighteen (18) months or longer, it must, if cyclical, be in cycles of at least twenty-six (26) weeks, irrespective of the length of the original agreement; provided that the initial cycle of any such contract may be made shorter than twenty-six (26) weeks in order to synchronize the performer's contract cycles with those of other performers on the same program.
C. All serial contracts must provide a per episode fee and a guaranteed minimum number of episodes.

With respect to all term contracts divided into cycles of twenty-six (26) weeks or less, in order for a Producer to average a performer's guarantee over a period of up to one year, a performer's personal service contract must so specify. If such personal service contract does not so specify, the guarantee cannot be averaged over any period of time in excess of the performer's then current cycle, except that if the cycles provided in the first year of the performer's employment contract are less than twenty-six (26) weeks, the first and second cycles may be combined for purposes of averaging the guarantee and the third and fourth cycles may be combined for purposes of averaging the guarantee, but in no event shall the combined period be more than twenty-six (26) weeks. It is understood that a performer's guarantee may, in any event, be averaged over a cycle (or other guaranteed term) which is in excess of twenty-six (26) weeks. This provision shall be applicable to all contracts entered into or renewed thirty (30) or more days after March 12, 1993.
D. Cancellation of the contract shall require at least four (4) weeks' notice of the cancellation before the end of any cycle (except where cycles of at least twenty-six (26) weeks are required pursuant to A. or B. above, in which case six (6) weeks' notice of cancellation before the end of any such cycle shall be required).
E. Where a performer on a serial program has been employed for more than fifty-two (52) weeks under any one contract or extension or renewal thereof, his individual contract of employment may not be cancelled because of unavoidable absence for a period not in excess of four (4) weeks where such absence is due to illness (including disability due to pregnancy); provided, however, that if such illness occurs at a period when Producer has the right to cancel such contract, this provision shall not in any way affect such right.

Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph D. above, the foregoing limitations shall not preclude the Producer from canceling an actor's term contract by reason of breach of contract, failure or inability to perform, non-performance and the like, program termination, or cessation of production because the program goes off the air.

Where notice is required under this Code of cancellation of a term employment contract, such notice shall be given in writing to the party(s) designated in such term contract to receive such notice, with a copy to SAG-AFTRA; provided that failure to give a copy to SAG-AFTRA shall not be deemed a failure to effectuate such notice.

The performer, or performer's agent, will be given a reasonable opportunity to review such contract or deal memo before being required to sign.

At the time of scheduling the first performance under a performer's individual contract, the Producer shall inform the performer of the date of the beginning and of the end of each cycle of such contract, subject to adjustment as permitted by cycle adjustment provisions set forth in such contract.
G. The Producer shall use either the first day of the workweek of the performer's first air date or production date, as the case may be, as the basis for determining cycles for purposes of calculating performers' guarantees, and except as otherwise specified in the performer's individual contract, the guarantee of each performer on a particular serial shall be calculated on a basis consistent with the policy, practice or procedure established by the Producer with respect to performers on that serial.

No individual contract under this Code shall permit the Producer to change at will the date used as the basis for calculating a performer's guarantee pursuant to the preceding sentence. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to affect any obligation with respect to time of payment, (or any existing waivers specifically agreed to by AFTRA and Producer prior to November 16, 1991).
H. If a performer is signed to a term agreement of one (1) year or longer in duration and performer relocates his/her residence to accept the employment, performer must be provided with a one (1) way coach airline ticket back to the point from which the performer relocated or, at the option of the performer, the cash equivalent of such ticket, if performer's employment is terminated before the end of his/her first year of employment.

In the event the Producer fails to use all the rehearsal hours so specified by him at the time the engagement was originally confirmed, the artist shall nevertheless be entitled to his full contract price, and in that event any credit the Producer may be entitled to under subparagraph A. shall be calculated on the basis of the rehearsal hours actually used. This subparagraph B. shall not apply to contracts having a non-cancellable term of thirteen (13) weeks or more.
C. With respect to serial performers under an individual contract which may be over and above the minimum terms and conditions specified herein, payments under this Code for the following specified items may not be credited against any portion of a performer's compensation: wardrobe fees, meal period penalties, overtime (including sixth and seventh day payments), short turnaround payments, travel payments, cosmetic alteration fees, hazardous performance payments, and doubling fees.

## 57. ADDITIONAL SERVICES

No service of the performer is contracted for except as specified herein. This paragraph is not intended to prevent the performer from contracting for services of a kind not covered by the agreement by individual contract at such rates of pay and under such conditions as the Producer and the performer shall agree, subject only to the fact that it shall not be in conflict with this agreement.# 58. CANCELLED INDIVIDUAL ENGAGEMENTS 

In the event the performer's engagement for the program is cancelled, Producer agrees, nevertheless, to pay the performer in full for all contracted time, as herein specified, except where cancellation is for gross insubordination or misconduct. Producer agrees that after the engagement is made, the risk of performer's incompetence is assumed by him.

## 59. CANCELLED PROGRAMS

A. If the recording of a program, or broadcast in the case of a live program is prevented by governmental regulation or order, or by a strike, or by the failure of broadcasting facilities because of war or other calamity such as fire, earthquake, hurricane, or similar acts of God, or because of the breakdown of said broadcasting facilities due to causes beyond the reasonable control of the Producer (such as the collapse of the transmitter due to structural defects), the Producer shall be relieved of any responsibility for the payment of compensation for the program so prevented; provided that in such case the Producer shall reimburse the performer for all out of pocket costs necessarily incurred in connection with such program. In addition, the performer shall be paid the full applicable rehearsal rate for all hours rehearsed prior to notice of cancellation.
B. The same consequences shall ensue if the program time is preempted by a Presidential broadcast, a news emergency or the telecast of a special news event and notice of cancellation for such purpose is given the performer promptly upon such notice having been received by the Producer.
C. If a substantial portion of a program or an element essential to the program is not shown because a program is interrupted for any of the reasons cited in subparagraph A. and B. above, the network or station(s) whose broadcast of such program was interrupted shall be entitled to rebroadcast the interrupted program in its entirety within a thirty (30) day period following the interrupted broadcast without incurring any additional payment to any performers in that program.
D. If a lawful strike should prevent or interrupt the production of a program covered by this Code, any performer on the program (other than a star performer) who is bound to Producer by an exclusive term agreement may accept other work during such strike; provided that such performer shall be and remain subject to immediate recall by the Producer.
E. The following provision is not applicable to serials:

When the production of a program is prevented, suspended or postponed by reason of the illness or injury of a series regular, the Producer shall have the right to suspend the services of all series regulars and series non-regulars, for the duration of the illness or injury; provided, however, such suspension shall not exceed five (5) consecutive production days.

The series regulars shall be paid a day's salary for each day or part thereof the performer is required and actually reports to work prior to such suspension if production which commences upon the conclusion of the suspension is on a program other than the one for which the suspension was called. Such compensation, if any, shall be calculated at the performer's pro-rata salary. If production which commences upon the conclusion of the suspension is on the same program for which the suspension was called, the days the series regular is required and actually reports to work prior to such suspension shall be added to the days worked after production is recommenced for purposes of calculating the series regulars' work time on that program.

The series non-regulars shall be paid a day's salary for each day or part thereof the performer is required and actually reports to work prior to such suspension provided that production which commences upon the conclusion of the suspension is on the same program for which the performer was engaged and the series non-regular doesnot have a bona fide professional commitment which would conflict with resumption of his/her services. If production of the same program does not commence upon the conclusion of the suspension or if a series non-regular has a bona fide professional commitment which conflicts with resumption of his/her services on the program, the series non-regular shall be deemed terminated and shall be compensated for a cancelled individual engagement as provided in Paragraph 58.

Any guaranteed employment for a series regular under his/her personal services agreement may be extended by the period of such suspension by giving written notice to such effect not later than the date of resumption of production following such suspension, unless the performer has a bona fide prior professional commitment which would conflict with such extension.

Producer agrees that a specific reference to Paragraph 59, "Force Majeure, Suspended or Cancelled Programs," shall be included in all contract performer personal service agreements entered into after April 11, 1993.
F. Where the program is cancelled or prevented for any reason other than those stated in subparagraphs A. or B. or E. above, or where insufficient advance notice has been given under subparagraphs A. or B. above, the Producer shall pay the performer his/her full contract price for the program so cancelled or prevented.

# 60. POSTPONED PROGRAMS 

A. Applicable to Non-Serials:

If a postponed recording of a program or broadcast in the case of a live program involves a change in the call of the performer to another day, the producer of such program shall not be required to pay a performer for such postponement provided: (1) the performer has been given notice of the postponement at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to the time of the performer's scheduled call; and (2) the performer is notified within fourteen (14) business days from the notice of the postponement of the date to which the performance is to be rescheduled. In the event that a recording of a program or broadcast in the case of a live program is postponed to a later hour of the same broadcast day (such change not having been made known to the performer twenty-four (24) hours in advance), then the hours intervening between the originally scheduled time for the performance and the time of the actual performance shall be considered rehearsal time. In the event that the postponed call conflicts with performers' bona fide prior professional commitments, the original call shall be considered as a cancelled individual engagement for which he/she shall be paid pursuant to Paragraph 58. However, in the event that the performer declines to perform on the rescheduled date for reasons other than a bona fide prior professional individual engagement, the producer shall be relieved of an obligation to pay the performer for the postponed recording of the program or broadcast. The performer must notify the Producer of his/her decision not to perform on the rescheduled date or his/her bona fide prior professional engagement at the time he/she is notified of the rescheduled performance date. Subject to the above provisions, the change of a performance from a live to a pre-recorded basis shall not be deemed to be a cancelled program. If a program is postponed more than once, payment to the performer must be made pursuant to Paragraph 58.
B. Applicable To Serials:

Where the recording of a program or broadcast or portion of a program or broadcast for which a performer is engaged is postponed, the postponed engagement shall be counted as an additional day.A. Except as otherwise provided in this Paragraph A. and in the advance payment provisions of Paragraph 19.C., payment to all performers shall be made not later than Thursday after the week during which such performance shall have taken place or in the case of a pre-recorded program, after time of final rendition of physical services. For this purpose, the workweek shall end at the close of broadcasting on Saturday. The minimum fees shall be net to the performer and no deductions whatever may be made therefrom (except for such taxes and withholdings as are required or authorized by law). Payment shall be made directly to the performer unless written authorization has been received by the employer from the performer authorizing payment to some other person, with a copy of such authorization to be delivered to SAG-AFTRA by performer. Not later than the date of first rehearsal, the Producer shall furnish a W-4 form (and, at the performer's request, a nonresident state income tax form if such forms are issued and available to the Producer) to each performer who has not previously filed such form with the Producer. The performer shall complete and return said form promptly to the Producer. If a performer under a term contract of thirteen (13) weeks or longer so requests, Producer shall pay such performer one-thirteenth $\left(1 / 13^{\text {th }}\right)$ of the performer's thirteen (13) week guarantee each week, and make any adjustments or additional payments that may be necessary at the end of the cycle. Payment to term contract performers in accordance with the preceding sentence shall constitute timely payment.
B. Penalty for Late Payment: In the event Producer fails to make timely payment, as provided in the preceding subparagraph A., the following cumulative penalty payments shall be added to the compensation due and payable to the performer for each day (beginning with the day following the date of default) on which payment remains not made or received:
\$5.00 for each day
up to a maximum penalty payment of $\$ 150.00$ (30 days); thereafter the penalty payment shall cease, unless SAG-AFTRA or the performer serves or has served upon the designated representative of the Producer (if no specific representative is designated, the management official of the Producer who is SAG-AFTRA's regular contact) by certified mail, return receipt requested, a notice that the default continues. If the penalty had ceased, it shall resume on receipt of such notice and shall continue until payment is made; provided, further however, that Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays which Producer observes shall not be computed as penalty days, and further provided that the penalty shall not be invoked or payable when the performer fails to furnish his completed W-4 form promptly or when the performer, having been furnished an engagement contract on or before show day, fails to return the signed contract promptly, or when there is a bona fide dispute as to compensation.
C. All required payments of additional compensation for replays and foreign uses, unless included with or in the payment made pursuant to subparagraph A. above, shall be made by check delivered to SAG-AFTRA, payable to the order of the performer entitled thereto or to a person designated in accordance with subparagraph A. Compliance herewith shall constitute payment to the performer. SAG-AFTRA shall promptly forward each such check to the performer entitled thereto or to a person designated in accordance with subparagraph A. If Producer fails to make payment for replays within thirty (30) days after the time specified in Paragraph 73.B., or for foreign use within the time specified in Paragraph 73.F.(2)(e) but thereafter makes payment within thirty (30) days after such payment became due, Producer shall be liable for a penalty of five percent (5\%) of the overdue amount which sum shall be added to the compensation due and payable to the performer. If payment is not made within such thirty (30) day period Producer shall remain liable for such five percent (5\%) penalty, but shall not be liable for any further penalty unless and until he receives written notice that a payment is more than thirty (30) days overdue, in which event he shall be liable for an additional penalty each month of five percent (5\%) (based on the amount of the compensation which first became overdue) up to a maximum penalty of one-hundred percent(100\%) of the compensation originally due and payable to the performer. The penalties set forth in this subparagraph shall not be invoked or payable when the performer has failed to furnish his completed W-4 form promptly or when the performer, having been furnished an engagement contract on or before show day, fails to return the signed contract promptly, or when there is a bona fide dispute as to compensation.

An inadvertent failure on the part of the Producer to comply with the provisions of this subparagraph C. shall in no event constitute a default by the Producer or a breach of this Code, provided such failure is cured promptly after notice thereof from SAG-AFTRA.
D. To the extent practicable, payments to performers shall be accompanied by a breakdown of the earnings included in the payment. With regard to earnings for which a breakdown is not provided, for a reasonable period of time the Producer shall make earnings breakdown information available to the individual performers upon request.

For unemployment insurance purposes, the Producer will supply performers with the employer of record's name, address, state identification number (if any) and, upon request, dates worked and whether the payment is for residuals.

# 62. DEDUCTIONS FOR SOCIAL SECURITY AND WITHHOLDING TAXES 

Social Security and withholding taxes shall be deducted from all employees covered by this Code regardless of whether they are part-time or full time, staff or freelance employees.

## 63. DISABILITY INSURANCE

In states which have state disability insurance laws requiring deductions, such deductions shall be noted on the checks or statements given to the performer. The check or statement should also include the employer's name or registration number in those states where unemployment insurance laws require that such information be given to the employee by the employer.

## 64. NON-WAIVER OF RIGHTS

The acceptance by a member of SAG-AFTRA, for any work or services under this Agreement, of payment or other consideration in money, by check, or in any other form, shall not be deemed a waiver by such SAG-AFTRA member, nor constitute a release or discharge by him, of such SAG-AFTRA member's rights either under this Agreement or under any Agreement subject to this Agreement, for additional compensation or of his contractual rights. Releases, discharges, notations on checks, cancellations, etc., and similar devices which may operate as waivers or releases shall be null and void to the extent provided for above unless SAG-AFTRA's prior written approval is first had and obtained.

## 65. NOTICE ON GROUP SINGERS, GROUP DANCERS AND ANNOUNCERS

Any individual member (not under contract) of a singing or dancing group, or an announcer, who has appeared on six (6) or more consecutive programs shall receive at least two (2) weeks' written notice of discharge except for cause. However, any member who auditions for a program, as a member of a group, shall, in the event that said group is accepted for the program, be considered to be a member of said group and may not be discharged without justifiable cause without SAG-AFTRA's consent as long as the group remains on the program or for a period of thirteen (13) weeks, whichever is less.Notice of this agreement will be given to SAG-AFTRA members, and they will contract subject thereto, and as to such Producers who either sign this agreement or signify their intention to abide thereby, the member will sign contracts subject to the fulfillment of all obligations of such Producer hereunder. In the event that the SAG-AFTRA National Office requests a copy of the personal contract of a performer, the Company will supply such contract to the SAG-AFTRA National Office when requested on a selective basis provided that it receives assurances from the SAG-AFTRA National Office that it has a bona fide need for such contract on a particular program in connection with a potential grievance, for this purpose.

# 67. STANDARD CLAUSE FOR INDIVIDUAL CONTRACT 

Every contract (whether written or oral) between Producers under this Code and any Artist must contain and shall be deemed to contain the following clause:

## A. Supplemental Markets:

The rights of Producer in television programs produced under this Code shall include the right to exhibit such programs in Supplemental Markets, subject to the provisions of the SAG-AFTRA Supplemental Markets Agreement, Exhibit D.

## B. Pay Television:

The provisions applicable to the engagement of performers by Producer to perform on programs produced under this Code for initial release on Pay Television are set forth in Exhibit E (Pay Television, Video Disc/Videocassette provisions).
"Pay Television" (also known as Pay Cable), as used in this Code, means exhibition on a home-type television screen by means of telecast, cable, closed circuit or CATV where substantially all systems to which the program is licensed meet the following tests:
(1) Where a separate channel is provided for which the subscriber pays a separate fee (which fee is a major charge relative to other charges made to the subscriber) for that channel; and/or
(2) Where the subscriber pays for each program he selects (except that a program he selects for which only a token charge is made shall not be considered a Pay Television program); and/or
(3) Where the subscriber pays a fee for an encoded telecast or telecast which fee is a major charge relative to other fees paid for encoded telecasts.

It is expressly understood that "Pay Television" does not include theatrical exhibition and does not include methods such as community antennas and community television systems when used to supplement free television transmission.
C. Basic Cable:

Paragraph 69(c) of the 1979-82 Agreement contained the following provision:
"If Producer desires to engage performers to perform on any program produced primarily for release on more than one Basic Cable system (as distinguished from a program produced for Pay Television, as defined in subparagraph (b) of this Paragraph 69), Producer will give AFTRA notice of such desire not later than sixty (60) days prior to the date upon which it intends to engage such performers. AFTRA and Producer shall thereafter meet and bargain in good faith for the purpose of agreeing upon terms and conditions of employment and compensation for performers engaged by the Company to perform on such programs, and if no agreement is reached between Producer and AFTRA with respect thereto within sixty (60) days after commencement of negotiations, and if Producer then reaffirms its intention to produce such a program, then AFTRA may, upon sixty (60) days written notice to Producer, instruct its members to refuse to perform services on such programs."

Pursuant to the requirements of that provision, Producer and AFTRA met. The negotiations are continuing. Pending agreement, all rights expressed therein remain in effect.

It is expressly understood that "Basic Cable" does not include theatrical exhibition and does not include methods such as community antennas and community television systems when used to supplement free television transmission.A. This Agreement covers live network television programs originating in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.; recorded programs used to supplement live broadcasts, film sequences made especially for the entertainment portion of a live program, and any other program produced or recorded as provided in Paragraph 72 hereof.
B. This Code shall apply to Traveling Shows, as the term is generally understood in the Industry, which normally originate at one of the production centers covered by this Code, regardless of the point of origination of the broadcast. This Code also shall apply to all persons covered by this Code on sports broadcasts produced by a signatory to this Code or to the letters of adherence and broadcast on the network regardless of the point of origination of the broadcast.
C. When a program is produced or co-produced by a signatory to this Code or to the letters of adherence for broadcast to the network but said program originates at a point other than New York, Chicago, Los Angeles or Washington, D.C., the terms and conditions of this Code (except the provisions of Paragraph 84 hereof when inapplicable under the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, as amended) shall nevertheless apply to such network program. Excluded from the coverage of the preceding sentence are programs (but not cut-ins or feeds to other programs other than news inserts which are governed by the provisions of Paragraph 75 of this Code) in the field of news and public affairs, except to the extent that participation in such programs may be covered by the network staff newsperson's agreement: "remote" originations of events (such as a rodeo or sportscar races) which by their nature feature persons who are not performers within the meaning of this Code and which as a matter of course occur in the locality from which the broadcast originates; religious programs broadcast in connection with observance of particular religious holidays.

SAG-AFTRA agrees to consider and grant (when warranted) waivers of the provisions of this subparagraph C. for network program originations in special circumstances.

# 71. DEFINITION OF NETWORK PROGRAM 

A network television program is one which is broadcast over two (2) or more television stations in the United States, its territories and possessions and Canada except programs broadcast on regional networks now existing in radio as provided in the SAG-AFTRA Code of Fair Practice.

(6) Domestic Replay in a Foreign Language - Producer shall have the option of applying the payment provisions in subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c), below to the second and any subsequent broadcast in any domestic area of a network television program in a language other than English in lieu of the foregoing provisions of subparagraph 73.B. governing domestic replays in which case such broadcasts shall not be treated as domestic replays:
(a) The Producer will pay for the benefit of the performers on such a program two percent ( $2 \%$ ) of the "Distributor's gross receipts" (as defined in Exhibit D) from such broadcast(s) of such program in a language other than English, provided, however, the scale payment due each performer shall not exceed one and one-half percent $(11 / 2 \%)$ per performer and the scale payment due each off-camera announcer shall not exceed one-half percent ( $1 / 2 \%$ ) per announcer.Health and Retirement contribution shall be paid in addition to such payments.
(b) This two percent (2\%) payment shall be for the benefit of all performers on the program, except for background actors. The two percent ( $2 \%$ ) payment shall be distributed pro rata to the performers on the basis of a two-to-one ratio for principal performers against other performers. Performers on non-serial dramatic programs production of which commences on or after November 16, 2014, shall share in distributor's gross receipts on a pro rata basis of 3-2-1 rather than 2 to 1 . The parties agree that performers engaged under the Five Lines or Less category shall be regarded as a " 1 ". In the event any performer has individually negotiated with the Producer an individual payment formula for such distribution, his pro rata share shall be credited against the payment provided for in his individual contract. Distribution of the pro rata payments shall be made either directly to the performers by the Producer or to SAGAFTRA for distribution to the performers as the parties may mutually determine. Additionally, a contribution based upon a percentage of the fees payable under this subparagraph shall be made to the AFTRA Health and Retirement Funds. The applicable percentage shall be the same as the percentage of gross compensation payable to the AFTRA Health and Retirement Funds under the AFTRA or SAG-AFTRA Code under which the program was produced.
(c) If any agreement for broadcasts in a language other than English includes more than one (1) program, or includes both rights to telecast in a language other than English and other rights, the Producer shall make a reasonable allocation for the purpose of determining payments due hereunder.

The persons who perform the dubbing shall not be entitled to any other payment for use of the program.
(7) Release to Public Television - When a television program produced under this Code is released for broadcast on public broadcasting station(s), Producer shall have the option of applying the replay provisions of this Paragraph 73.B. or of paying the performers who are entitled to payments for replays, either:
(a) the first replay fee, which payment shall entitle the Producer to the initial releases provided in the National SAG-AFTRA Public Television Agreement, but not the extended broadcast releases provided in that Agreement, or
(b) the applicable program rate under the National SAG-AFTRA Public Television Agreement which rate shall entitle the Producer to the initial uses provided therein. Further uses shall be subject to the applicable payment provisions of such Agreement.

No use paid for under options (a) or (b) above shall be considered a domestic replay under this Code.
C. Syndicated Programs shall be governed by all the terms, conditions and provisions of Paragraphs 72 and 73 of this Code, except as otherwise expressly provided in this subparagraph C. to wit:(1) A recorded program which is not broadcast as a network program but has been pre-recorded for syndication on local stations may be played on local non-interconnected stations provided that payment in advance for prerecording such program shall be made to each performer at not less than the rates, terms and conditions provided in this Code for a network broadcast.

(a) For promotional purposes as provided in Paragraph 88.
(b) Where news excerpts from news programs are utilized in other news programs in accordance with the conditions set forth in Paragraph 75.C. Furthermore, SAG-AFTRA will not claim a breach of this or any previous AFTRA or SAG-AFTRA Code if Producer without payment of additional compensation uses an excerpt of no more than two (2) minutes in length from any program in a news program or, in a basic news context in a public affairs type program.
(c) As flashbacks (brief scenes from one episode in a series used as part of a story in another episode in a series) provided that a performer in the flashback who is not otherwise engaged to perform services on the program in which the flashback is utilized shall be entitled to one-hundred percent ( $100 \%$ ) of the applicable minimum program fee, or if not under contract at the time of such broadcast, onehundred percent ( $100 \%$ ) of his performance fee for the episode used in the flashback.
(d) Where excerpts from different programs are utilized in any program devoted to annual television awards produced under this or any other AFTRA or SAG-AFTRA Code, without compensation to the star performers, provided that consent from the star performer is obtained (which consent may be obtained in the performer's individual contract) and further provided that performers other than star performers appearing in such excerpt(s) shall be paid an amount equal to the first replay fee based on the minimum program fee of the program from which the excerpt(s) is taken; however, where excerpts from programs are utilized on the annual Emmy Awards (daytime or nighttime), such excerpts may be utilized without compensation to or consent from the performer(s). Further, where excerpt(s) from programs featuring a portion of a current nominatedperformance, or in connection with a lifetime achievement award or the like, are utilized in the Grammy Awards, Academy Awards, or Tony Awards, such excerpt(s) may be utilized without compensation to the performer(s), provided that in both cases consent from the star performer(s) is obtained (which consent may be obtained in the performer's individual contract).

This right is limited to programs where the excerpts run not more than ten ( $10 \%$ ) of the program time or, in the case of anniversary shows or personality retrospectives, fifty percent $(50 \%)$ of the program time.
(f) When used for purposes of recapping the story to date in the context of a serial, multi-part program, episodic series, unit series or anthology; provided, however, that if such recap shall exceed ninety (90) seconds in length when used on a program less than sixty (60) minutes in total length, or exceed one hundred-eighty (180) seconds in length when used on a program of sixty (60) minutes or more in total length, Producer shall pay the performers appearing in the excerpts used in the recap in accordance with subparagraph (2) below. When used in a recap in a serial, an excerpt can be used only once under the provisions of this subparagraph (1)(f) and any subsequent use of such excerpt in a serial shall require payment in accordance with subparagraph (1)(c) above. A recap consists of brief scenes from past episodes in a series or multi-part program used at the beginning of an episode to bring the story up-to-date.
(2) For any use of excerpts, after February 28, 1995, from an entertainment program that is not provided for in subparagraph (1) above, Producer shall pay the performers appearing in such excerpts as follows:
(a) If the excerpt(s) is used in a program other than a local program, Producer shall pay to each performer appearing in three (3) minutes or less of such excerpt(s) from a given program the minimum program fee of the program from which the excerpt(s) is taken or the minimum program fee of the program in which the excerpt(s) is used, whichever is higher. If such excerpt(s) is longer than three (3) minutes, Producer shall negotiate the payment for such use with each performer appearing in such excerpt(s) with a minimum payment of the minimum program fee of the program in which the excerpt(s) is used. For subsequent broadcasts of the program in which the excerpt(s) is used, the performer shall receive replay fee(s) based on the minimum program fee paid for the use of the excerpts(s). None of the above payments may be credited against the performer's overscale compensation or individual guarantee. Only excerpts from a single episode are aggregated to measure whether the excerpt(s) is longer than three (3) minutes for purposes of determining whether the Producer is required to negotiate the payment for such use with the performer(s) appearing in the excerpt(s).
(b) If the excerpt(s) is used on a local program, Producer shall pay each performer appearing in such excerpt(s) fifty percent ( $50 \%$ ) of the payments provided in subparagraph (2)(a) above.
(3) Use of excerpts in accordance with this Paragraph 73.D. shall not be deemed replays of the program(s) from which the excerpt( $(s)$ is taken.(4) Nothing herein shall require additional payment to a performer in an excerpt(s), if such performer is otherwise engaged to perform services on the program in which the excerpt is utilized.
(5) The provisions of this Paragraph 73.D. shall apply to compilation programs.
(6) No compensation shall be payable pursuant to this Paragraph 73.D. to a background actor.
(7) The production company which actually produces the program containing excerpts requiring payment shall be obligated to make such payment, but if such Producer is not a signatory to this Code, Producer shall remain liable for payments due hereunder.
(8) (a) In the event that more than seventy-five percent ( $75 \%$ ) of a program (except a program produced for pay television or video discs/videocassettes, which is covered by Paragraph 73.D.(10)), consists of excerpts, all performers appearing in the excerpts shall be paid not less than two (2) times the minimum program fee of the program from which the excerpt(s) is taken or two (2) times the minimum program fee of the program in which the excerpt(s) is used, whichever is higher, based upon the performers' original performance category. No excerpts from a program may be used under this subparagraph (8), except as set forth below in the second paragraph of this paragraph (8)(a), without the consent of the performers appearing in the excerpts, which consent must be obtained at the time of contemplated use hereunder unless the performer has given prior written consent specifically referring to this subparagraph (8). However, if the Producer has made a bona fide attempt to locate the performer and is unable to find the performer, the Producer shall notify SAG-AFTRA, and if SAGAFTRA is unable to find the performer within a reasonable time, the Producer may use such excerpt(s) without consent. In the event a performer(s) and the Producer negotiate for such excerpt use and performer(s) refuses to grant consent for the use of such excerpt(s), Producer may appeal the reasonableness of such refusal to a committee established by SAG-AFTRA's National Board of Directors, and both Producer and performer shall be bound by the determination of such Committee. None of the above payments may be credited against the performer's overscale compensation or individual guarantee.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no consent is required for the use of excerpts from episodes of a single series (including a daytime serial) in a program, which consists of seventy-five percent ( $75 \%$ ) or more excerpts, produced for telecast as: i) a regular or special episode or retrospective program of that series, or ii) a retrospective program related to a series that is no longer on the air, provided that consent shall be required of specialty acts in variety program excerpts.
(b) If the excerpts are used on a local program, the Producer shall pay each performer appearing in such excerpts fifty percent ( $50 \%$ ) of the payments provided in subparagraph (8)(a) above.
(c) As an alternative to obtaining consent as permitted in subparagraph (a) above, the Producer may use the following procedure to obtain the consent of any performer whose appearance is incidental to the compilation program and to the excerpt(s) in which he or she appears:(i) The Producer will send a written consent request by certified mail, return receipt requested, or other means whereby delivery to the performer can be verified, to the performer's last known address on file with the local SAG-AFTRA office, or to an address known to the Producer to be more recent. A postage pre-paid, addressed envelope will be enclosed for the performer's response. The Producer will make a good faith effort to send a copy of this consent request to a known agent of the performer, but failure to do so shall not affect the validity of this request.
(ii) The consent request shall include the following notice to the performer:
"If you fail to respond to this request within fifteen (15) business days of its delivery, the Producer will be deemed to have obtained your consent to use the excerpts for the compilation program(s), as described in the request."
(iii) If neither the performer nor an agent acting on behalf of the performer responds within fifteen (15) business days of the request's delivery, the Producer will be deemed to have obtained the performer's consent to use the excerpts for the compilation program(s) as described in the request.
(9) Nothing herein shall affect Producer's right to replay an edited-down program, where editing is required by program time exigencies, provided that all performers who appear in the original program shall be paid their applicable replay fee.
(10) If an excerpt from a program produced for free television under this or any previous Network Television Code is used in a program produced for pay television, video discs/videocassettes or basic cable, the provisions of this subparagraph 73.D. shall apply.
(a) In the event more than seventy-five percent ( $75 \%$ ) of such a program produced for pay television consists of excerpts, Producer shall pay each performer, irrespective of the number of excerpts in which he/she appears, a single payment of twice the highest minimum program fee applicable to his/her performance in any program from which an excerpt is being taken or two (2) times the minimum program fee of the program in which the excerpt(s) is used were it produced for free television, whichever is higher. In the event such compilation program is produced solely for video disc/videocassette release, Producer shall pay each performer a single payment of the highest minimum program fee applicable to his/her performance in any program from which an excerpt is being taken, or the minimum program fee of the program in which the excerpt(s) is used were it produced for free television, whichever is higher. Such initial payment shall entitle the Producer to the use set forth in Paragraph 2.B. of Exhibit E of this Code. Additional compensation shall be paid pursuant to the provisions of Paragraphs 3, 5 and 7 of Exhibit E of this Code. None of the above payments may be credited against the performer's overscale compensation or individual guarantee.

No excerpts from a program may be used under this subparagraph (10) without the current consent of the performers appearing in the excerpts unless the performer has given prior written consent specifically referring to subparagraph 8 in the 1985-1988 Network TV Code or subparagraph 10 in a subsequent Network TV Code, or combination thereof. Where the Producer has been unable to locatethe performer in order to obtain his/her consent, SAG-AFTRA agrees to assist the Producer in locating the performer.
(b) Additional Option for Serials:

As an additional option, serial producers may release compilation programs to the videocassette market with the payment of $\$ 150.00$ per performer per videocassette compilation program, as an advance against future Supplemental Market payments, if any, as provided in Exhibit D: i.e., $4.5 \%$ for the first $\$ 1,000,000.00$ of distributor's gross and $5.4 \%$ thereafter. Under such option the producer is prohibited from obtaining the performer's consent at the time of initial employment and must do so at the time of contemplated use. For this Paragraph (10)(b) only, a performer may consent to the incorporation of one (1) or more excerpts into one (1) or more videocassette compilation programs at any time other than during initial employment or subsequent contract negotiations provided the material to be used as an excerpt(s) was produced and broadcast prior to the date of consent and provided that the consent agreement shall specify the time period over which such performances were made, the name of the program(s) from which the excerpt(s) are taken, and the number of videocassette compilation programs to be produced. Further, such consent agreement must specifically set forth the above-referenced payment of $\$ 150.00$ per videocassette compilation program and that such payment is an advance against future Supplemental Market payments, if any, as provided in Exhibit D. None of the above payments may be credited against the performer's overscale compensation or individual guarantee.

If SAG-AFTRA believes the industry has abused the practices of free distribution of cassettes for promotional purposes the issue may be referred to the Joint Committee.
(c) (i) If the Producer has made a bona fide attempt to locate the performer and is unable to do so, the Producer must notify SAG-AFTRA, and if SAG-AFTRA is unable to locate the performer within a reasonable time, the Producer may use such excerpts without consent.
(ii) In the event a performer and the Producer negotiate for the use of an excerpt and the performer refuses to grant consent for the use of such excerpt, the Producer may appeal the reasonableness of such refusal to a committee established by SAG-AFTRA's National Board of Directors, and both the Producer and performer shall be bound by the determination of the Committee.
(iii) As an alternative to obtaining consent as permitted in subparagraphs (10)(a) and (b) above, the Producer may use the following procedure to obtain the consent of any performer whose appearance is incidental to the compilation program and to the excerpt(s) in which he or she appears:
A. The Producer will send a written consent request by certified mail, return receipt requested, or other means whereby delivery to the performer can be verified, to the performer's last known address on file with the local SAG-AFTRA office, or to an address known to the Producer to be more recent. A postage pre-paid, addressed envelope will be enclosed for the performer's response. The Producer will make a good faith effort to send a copy of this consentrequest to a known agent of the performer, but failure to do so shall not affect the validity of this request.
B. The consent request shall include the following notice to the performer:

If you fail to respond to this request within fifteen (15) business days of its delivery, the Producer will be deemed to have obtained your consent to use the excerpts for the compilation program(s), as described in the request.
C. If neither the performer nor an agent acting on behalf of the performer responds within fifteen (15) business days of the request's delivery, the Producer will be deemed to have obtained the performer's consent to use the excerpts for the compilation program(s) as described in the request.
(iv) Payment for use of the excerpts described herein shall be made in accordance with the applicable provisions set forth in subparagraph (10)(a) and (b) above.
(v) Excerpts of not more than an aggregate of one (1) minute in length from a single compilation videocassette may be used to promote the sale of that videocassette without additional compensation, provided that where multiple videocassettes are being promoted together, each excerpt used is from at least one of the videocassettes being promoted for sale, and provided further that the promotional announcement may not exceed three (3) minutes in length.
E. The provisions of subparagraph B. of this Paragraph 73 shall not apply to recordings of commercial inserts, cut-ins, hitch-hikes and cow-catchers, or other services covered by Paragraph 4 of this Code, and the following shall apply:

When a performer is engaged pursuant to this Code, whether the performance is actually done "live" or is pre-recorded from an audition or rehearsal or in any other manner (so long as the artist's engagement is for a "live" performance), payment for commercials (announcements, cut-ins, hitch-hikes, cow-catchers, or otherwise) shall be made pursuant to the provisions of Paragraphs 2, 4, 26, 27 and 46 of this Code, as applicable. When such "live" announcement is replayed as part of the program in which it was originally included payment shall be: (1) for performers and chorus singers and dancers paid pursuant to Paragraph 46.G. and H. for the original "live" performance - the applicable payment provided in Paragraph 46.G. and H. will be made for the commercial announcement services in addition to the payment pursuant to subparagraph B. of this Paragraph 73 for replay of the program; (2) for performers, including announcers, in performances other than in (1) above - the full applicable payment made for the commercial announcement services, or the program rate if originally paid, but in no event more than the full applicable program rate pursuant to Paragraph 2 or Paragraph 4, as applicable.

In the event such "live" announcement is replayed as a separate announcement, or as part of a program other than that in which it was originally included, payment shall be made pursuant to the provisions of the SAG-AFTRA Television Recorded Commercials Contract.

In no event shall the provisions of the SAG-AFTRA Television Recorded Commercials Contract be construed as applicable to any announcement referred to in this paragraph unless the individual contract of the performer contains a specific provision so authorizing the additional broadcast use of his services in theannouncement and a copy of such contract shall be filed and approved by SAGAFTRA prior to any use under the said Recorded Commercials Contract.

Approval by SAG-AFTRA shall be presumed unless notice to the contrary is given to Producer within forty-eight (48) hours after receipt of the contract by SAGAFTRA.

In the event a performer's individual contract is of longer duration than the said SAGAFTRA Code, then, for such period of duration and until a new Code is agreed to, we covenant not to bring or maintain any action or proceedings against you, because you refrain from rendering your services under this contract by reason of any strike or work stoppage (whether partial or complete) called or ordered by SAG-AFTRA. In such event we covenant (a) that neither SAG-AFTRA nor any of its representatives shall be deemed to have induced you to breach this contract, and (b) that for the direct benefit of SAGAFTRA and its representatives, we will not bring or maintain any action or proceedings against them, or any of them, based upon or arising either out of the existence of this contract or out of your failure to render services under this contract.

The award of the Arbitrator shall be final and binding upon all parties to the proceeding during the period of this agreement, and judgment upon such award may be entered by any party in the highest court of the forum, state or federal having jurisdiction.
(3) The parties agree that the provisions of this Paragraph shall be a complete defense to any suit, action or proceeding instituted in any Federal, State or local court or before any administrative tribunal with respect to any controversy or dispute which arises during the period of this Agreement and which is therefore arbitrable as set forth above. The arbitration provisions of this Agreement shall, with respect to such controversy or dispute, survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.
(4) SAG-AFTRA shall be an ex officio party to all arbitration proceedings hereunder in which any artist is involved, and SAG-AFTRA may do anything which an artist named in such proceeding might do.

In the event an Arbitrator (selected pursuant to (6)(a)) is unable to perform his duties for any reason whatsoever the said Broadcasting Companies and SAG-AFTRA shall mutually agree upon a successor immediately and if they are unable to so agree then the procedure set forth in Paragraph 95.C.(7) hereof shall become applicable.

Immediately upon serving a demand for arbitration, a copy of the demand shall be filed with the American Arbitration Association, which shall select the single Arbitrator for the hearing in accordance with whether SAG-AFTRA and the said Broadcasting Companies have utilized either method (6)(a) or (6)(b) for the designation of the arbitrator.

If the method (6)(b) has been utilized and therefore a Panel of Arbitrators has been selected for each network center then the Arbitrator shall be selected from the Panel named for the network center in which the demand is filed. In any case, both parties shall be notified by the American Arbitration Association of the Arbitrator assigned to their case immediately upon his appointment.

(7) All of the foregoing provisions of this paragraph 95 shall be effective immediately upon the execution of this Code, but pending only the utilization of either method (6)(a) or (6)(b) for the designation of the arbitrator, and the designation in writing to the American Arbitration Association of the name of the single SAG-AFTRA-Industry Arbitrator or the Panel of Arbitrators, the following arbitration provisions shall apply:
(a) SAG-AFTRA, the Producer concerned, or (with the written consent of AFTRA endorsed upon the demand for arbitration) the artist concerned, may demand such arbitration in writing. A single neutral arbitrator shall be selected to resolve the dispute, pursuant to the Voluntary Labor Arbitration Rules then obtaining of the American Arbitration Association.
(b) In the demand for arbitration, the party seeking arbitration may specify that the arbitration shall be conducted under either of the following procedures:(i) The hearing shall be held on two (2) days' notice and shall be concluded within fourteen (14) days unless otherwise ordered by the Arbitrator(s). The award of the Arbitrator(s) shall be made within seven (7) days after the close of the submission of evidence.

The award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon all parties to the proceedings during the period of this agreement, and judgment upon such award may be entered by any party in the highest court of the forum, state or federal, having jurisdiction.
(c) The parties agree that the provisions of this Paragraph shall be a complete defense to any suit, action or proceeding instituted in any Federal, State or local court or before any administrative tribunal with respect to any controversy or dispute which arises during the period of this Agreement and which is therefore arbitrable as set forth above. The arbitration provisions of this agreement shall, with respect to such controversy or dispute, survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.
(d) SAG-AFTRA shall be an ex officio party to all arbitration proceedings hereunder in which any artist is involved, and SAGAFTRA may do anything which an artist named in such proceeding might do. Copies of all notices, demands, and other papers filed by any party in arbitration proceedings, and copies of all motions, actions or proceedings in court following the award, shall be promptly filed with SAG-AFTRA.
(e) Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to give the Arbitrators the authority, power or right to alter, amend, change, modify, add to or subtract from any of the provisions of this Code.

# 97. NO DISCRIMINATION/AFFIRMATIVE ACTION 

## A. Policy:

Producer agrees not to discriminate against any performer because of race, creed, color, national origin, sex, age, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability, in accordance with applicable state and federal law. In accordance with this policy, Producer shall cast performers belonging to all groups in all types of roles, including continuing roles, having due regard for the requirements of and suitability for the role.

In accordance with the above, SAG-AFTRA reaffirms its policy of nondiscrimination with respect to admission to membership, and rights of membership and Producer agrees to participate in the Joint Industry-SAG-AFTRA Committee established to administer the policies and procedures set forth in the 1963 Joint Statement of Policy. That Policy, as updated to conform to the first paragraph hereof, designed to continue and strengthen the implementation of the longstanding policy against discrimination in the employment of talent, reads as follows:

SAG-AFTRA, the employers, producers, networks, stations, advertising agencies, independent packagers, transcription companies, phonograph recording companies, agents, managers, impresarios and others, are in agreement that the following policies and procedures will be continued and strengthened in the future:
(1) Discrimination shall not be practiced against any performer, or any applicant for employment as a performer, because of race, creed, color, national origin, sex, age, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability; (a) in admission to membership to SAG-AFTRA together with all the rights and privileges of full membership in SAG-AFTRA as established in the SAG-AFTRA constitution; (b) in the publicizing of auditions and interviews; (c) in calling or requesting the appearance of performers for auditions or interviews; (d) in the hiring of performers, in the discharge or replacement of performers; (e) in the staging of a production; or (f) in any other dealings with or treatment of performers.
(2) To word casting notices in such a way as not to discourage minority group members from inquiring, applying or auditioning. Casting notices shall state that Producer is an Equal Opportunity Employer.
(3) When a role being cast depicts a person with a specific disability, the Producer agrees to include that fact in the casting specifications so as to enhance the opportunity for performers with similar disabilities to audition for the role.(4) When conducting interviews or auditions for casting purposes, representation by an agent or other performers' representatives shall not be a requirement for an audition.
(5) To the extent that any producer keeps files of performers' names, pictures, resumes, etc., there will be no discrimination in keeping of such files on account of race, color, creed, national origin, age, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability.
(6) To instruct all casting agents and performers' representatives to refer performers without regard to race, creed, color, national origin, age, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability.
(7) To select applicants for audition, interview and employment, and employ performers on the basis of ability in all roles without regard to race, color, creed, national origin, sex, age, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability, subject to bona fide job qualifications and requirements.
(8) Producer shall cast performers in accordance with the above policy in all types of roles, having due regard for the requirements of, and suitability for, the role, so that, for example, the American Scene may be portrayed realistically. To that end, due regard shall be given to women, minorities, performers with disabilities and seniors in all aspects of society. The parties agree that the producer shall retain its exclusive creative prerogatives. In furtherance of the foregoing, the producer shall make good faith efforts to provide audition opportunities for women, minorities, individuals with physical disabilities and seniors.
(9) Producer shall not use any information contained on INS Form I-9 to discriminate against any performer on the basis of sex, race, age or national origin and the I-9 form will be used for the purpose for which it is intended, i.e., verifying that an employee may be employed pursuant to applicable Immigration Law and will not be made available for any other purpose.

The signatories to this Statement of Policy are SAG-AFTRA, employers, producers, networks, stations, independent packagers, transcription companies, phonograph recording companies, agents, managers, impresarios and others. Furthermore, the Policy Statement has been reviewed and agreed to by a committee representing advertisers and agencies employing and using talent in television and radio.
(10) Each signatory Producer agrees to comply with the substantive provision of Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, including applicable conforming amendments found within the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, with respect to performers employed under this Code, notwithstanding the fact that the ADA by its own terms may not otherwise apply to any such Producer.

(2) The first report to be submitted shall be for the first complete quarter following execution of this Code.
(3) The data which is furnished by Producer in accordance with this subparagraph B shall be for the purpose of facilitating any meeting which may be requested pursuant to subparagraph C , and is in no way intended to abridge the Producer's creative rights in the production of the program. SAG-AFTRA shall notify all Producers of the specific department at the SAG-AFTRA National Office to which the reports shall be addressed.
(4) In the event that Producer fails to submit the report within the time specified above, SAG-AFTRA may send a written notice of delinquency to the Producer requesting submission of the report within ten (10) working days of receipt of the notice.

The reports may be released only to appropriate SAG-AFTRA staff and to SAG-AFTRA members who will be participating with the Producer pursuant to subparagraph C and shall not be released to others without the express written consent of the Producer except that SAG-AFTRA may release aggregated industry-wide information that does not identify individual Producer(s).

If there is a substantial breach of this subparagraph (4) with respect to any individual quarterly report, or in the event there is a dispute as to whether or not a substantial breach has occurred, the matter may be referred to arbitration.

# C. Meetings with Producer Representatives: 

(1) If the Union or Producer has information which is the basis for a genuine concern that the policies expressed in this Paragraph are being violated, either party may request, on ten (10) days' notice, a meeting to discuss any matter relating to discrimination, fair employment, the policy expressed herein, its further implementation, the data submitted or any other matter relevant to equal employment opportunity for performers.
(2) If the Producer has an official with responsibilities for matters involving equal opportunity, the Union's request for a meeting shall be referred to such person who shall then be responsible for arranging the meeting with the appropriate Producer representatives.

(4) The ten (10) day notice may be given at any time but may not be given more often than once each quarter.(5) A party's alleged failure or refusal to participate in a meeting, as required by this subparagraph 97.C., shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure.
D. The parties agree that in order to promote the casting of performers belonging to all groups in all types of roles in daytime television, the three Networks (ABC, NBC and CBS) shall meet separately with SAG-AFTRA at least once per year for the purpose of discussing additional employment of minorities and disabled persons, progress in that area since the last meeting, new opportunities that may be arising, and any other issues relevant to this paragraph of the Code. Additionally, at the request of any independent Producer or SAG-AFTRA such Producer and SAGAFTRA shall meet.

Except as provided in subparagraphs B, C, and D, above, the matters covered in this Paragraph are not subject to the provisions of Paragraph 95.
F. Stunt Performers:

When applicable, and with due regard to the safety of cast, crew and other persons, women and minorities shall be considered for stunt doubling roles and for scripted stunts on a functional nondiscriminatory basis.

Producer shall endeavor to cast performers with disabilities for scripted stunts for which they are qualified and with due regard for safety, in roles portraying their particular disability such as wheelchair stunts or stunts involving the use of other adaptive devices, e.g., crutches, prostheses, etc. The SAG-AFTRA Liaison to the Performers with Disability Committee is among the resources that can be utilized in ascertaining the availability of such performers.

Where the stunt performer doubles for a role which is identifiable as female and/or Black/African American, Latino/Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander or Native American and the race and/or sex of the double are also identifiable, Producer shall endeavor to cast qualified persons of the same sex and/or race involved. The Producer shall endeavor to identify and recruit qualified minority and female stunt performers prior to the commencement of production.
G. Producer Meeting-Mediation:

Either Producer or SAG-AFTRA may submit a request, which shall be in writing, that a dispute under Paragraph 97.A. needs to be discussed. The Producer and Union shall meet within sixty (60) days after receipt by the non-moving party of such written notice, except that the parties may, by mutual agreement, extend such sixty (60) day period. If the meeting is not held due to the failure of the non-moving party to attend such meeting, the moving party may refer the matter to a nonbinding mediation with an independent mediator.

Producer and SAG-AFTRA agree to seek funding for the mediation program from the AFTRA Industry Cooperative Fund.

It is the intent of this provision that the best interests of the minor be the primary consideration of the parent/guardian and the adults in charge of production, with due regard to the age of the minor.

The term "minor," as used herein, means any performer under the age of eighteen (18) years, except that it shall not include any such performer if (1) the performer has satisfied the compulsory education laws of the state governing the performer's employment; (2) the performer is married; (3) the performer is a member of the Armed Forces; or (4) the performer is legally emancipated, in which case it is agreed that both the Producer and the minor shall comply fully with the legal terms of the minor's emancipation.
A. Interviews and Tests:

Calls for interviews and individual voice and photographic tests, fittings, wardrobe tests, make-up tests, production conferences, publicity and the like for children of school age shall be after school hours, provided such calls are completed prior to 8:00 p.m. Producer shall use its best efforts to assure that calls for such interviews and tests normally shall be limited to one (1) hour. Two (2) adults must be present at and during any such call involving a minor. Calls for actual production shall not be so limited.
B. Engagement:
(1) Producer shall advise the parent/guardian of the minor of the terms and conditions of the employment (studio, location, estimated hours, hazardous work, special abilities required, etc.), to the extent they are known, at the time of the hiring.
(2) Prior to the first date of the engagement, parent/guardian shall obtain, complete and submit to the Producer or his representative the appropriate documents required by state and local law related to the employment of the minor. Producer agrees to cooperate with SAG-AFTRA in an effort to secure a more efficient handling of the issuance of working permits for children from the N.Y. Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, and the Mayor's Office of the City of New York.
C. Work Hours:(1) The workday for a minor shall begin no earlier than 5:00 a.m. and shall end no later than 10:00 p.m. on evenings preceding school days. On evenings preceding non-school days the minor's workday shall end no later than 1:00 a.m. on the morning of the non-school day(s).
(a) Exceptions to "work hours":
(i) Where the Producer has obtained a waiver of the minor's work hours from the applicable state agency, SAG-AFTRA will be deemed to have granted an automatic waiver of this provision, in accordance with such state waiver.
(ii) SAG-AFTRA agrees to grant Producer's reasonable requests for waivers of the work hours provision.
(2) Producer shall set the first call at the beginning of the minor's employment and dismissal on the last day of the minor's employment so as to ensure that the minor will have a twelve (12) hour rest period prior to and at the end of the employment. For example, if a minor's last day of employment is Wednesday, and the minor will be attending school at 8:30 a.m. on Thursday, the minor must be dismissed by 8:30 p.m. on Wednesday.
D. Supervision:
(1) The parent/guardian must be present at all times while a minor is working, and shall have the right, subject to production requirements, to be within sight and sound of the minor. The presence of the parent/guardian will not interfere with the production. The parent/guardian will not bring other minors not engaged by Producer to the studio or location.
(2) The parent/guardian will accompany the minor to wardrobe, make-up, hairdressing and dressing room facilities. No dressing room shall be occupied simultaneously by a minor and an adult performer. This restriction shall not apply to minors under three (3) years old.
(3) Producer will provide a safe and secure place for minors to rest and play. The Producer agrees to supply cots during rehearsal for minor performers.
(4) No minor shall be required to work in a situation which places the child in clear and present danger to life or limb. If a minor believes he or she to be in such a dangerous situation after having discussed the matter with his or her guardian or the stunt coordinator, if one is present, then the minor shall not be required to perform in such situation regardless of the validity of his or her belief.
(5) When a Producer engages a minor, Producer must designate one (1) individual on each set to coordinate all matters relating to the welfare of the minor and shall notify the minor's parent/guardian of the name of such individual.
(6) If a minor is at location, the minor must leave the location as soon as reasonably possible following the end of his or her working day.
(7) Guardian, as that term is used in this Section, must be at least eighteen (18) years of age and be the minor's legal guardian or have the written permission of the minor's parent(s) to act as guardian.
(8) Producer will comply with all applicable child labor laws governing the employment of the minor in broadcasting, and will keep a summary of said laws in the production office, if such summary is readily available.
E. Education:Producer shall use its best efforts to ensure that the minor's education will not be neglected or hampered by the performer's employment and will comply with all applicable education laws.

If a minor is scheduled to work in the studio two (2) or more weekdays in a given week and on these days his or her work schedule is at least eight (8) hours each day and interferes with the performer's attendance at his/her regular school in a manner that precludes the performer from attending school for at least three (3) hours, then Producer shall provide the performer with sufficient study time, in periods of no less than twenty (20) minutes at any one time, so that performers will have had the opportunity to be in school and/or study for a total combined period of three (3) hours on each such day.

Any provision of this Paragraph which is inconsistent and less restrictive than any child labor law or regulation in applicable state or other jurisdiction shall be deemed modified to comply with such laws or regulations.

The provisions of this Paragraph shall prevail over any inconsistent and less restrictive terms contained in any other Paragraphs of this Code which would otherwise be applicable to the employment of the minor, but such terms shall be ineffective only to the extent of such inconsistency without invalidating the remainder of such Paragraphs.

Teachers shall have proper teaching credentials appropriate to the level of education required (i.e., primary or secondary level) from Washington D.C. or any state within the United States, but need not be credentialed by or a resident of the state wherein the minor's employment occurs unless otherwise required by law.

Producer agrees to provide a school facility, such as a schoolhouse, classroom, trailer schoolhouse or other schooling area, which closely approximates the basic requirements for classrooms, especially with respect to adequate lighting, heating, desks and chairs. Stationary buses or cars are not adequate school facilities unless used exclusively for the minors during instruction. A moving car or bus shall never be used as school facility; minors must not be taught while being transported to or from local locations.

As used in the preceding sentence, the term "recordings" shall have the meaning given in Paragraphs 70 and 72 of this Code. The Producer's obligation to pay such sum shall apply to the performer's gross compensation, including talent agent's commission (it being understood that nothing in this Code shall be construed as requiring Producer to pay a talent agent's commission), without any deductions whatsoever, whether pursuant to oral or written contracts entered into prior to, on or afterNovember 16, 1954. (However, this shall not be construed as requiring any duplication of payment made under any previous AFTRA or SAG-AFTRA Code.)

The bargaining parties hereby delegate to the Board of Trustees of the Health and Retirement Funds the authority to establish, acting in a settlor capacity and as delegates of the bargaining parties, the allocation of such contributions as between the Health Fund and the Retirement Fund.

(1) Dramatic Programs (Including Situation Comedies) Other Than SAGAFTRA Television Agreement and Serials:

With respect to services performed under this Code on and after February 27, 2012 (including all services such as rehearsal theretofore performed in connection therewith), and with respect to "recordings" produced under this Code and broadcast on and after February 27, 2012, on dramatic programs, except SAG-AFTRA Television Agreement programs covered in subparagraph (2), below, the Producer shall pay to the AFTRA Health and Retirement Funds a sum equal sixteen and one-half percent (16.5\%) (seventeen percent (17\%) effective January 1, 2015) of the gross compensation due each performer for such services and/or the use of such recordings. The allocations shall be as set forth in unnumbered subparagraphs two and three above.

Producer's obligation to make health and retirement contributions on gross compensation shall be limited to the following maximum amounts of compensation per performer per program episode on which contributions are due:

| 30 minute program episode | $\$ 15,000$ |
| :-- | :-- |
| 60 minute program episode | $\$ 24,500$ |
| 90 minute program episode | $\$ 33,000$ |
| 120 minute program episode | $\$ 40,000$ |
| Exclusivity payments | $\$ 40,000$ |

(2) SAG-AFTRA Television Agreement Programs:

With respect to services performed under this Code (including all services such as rehearsal theretofore performed in connection therewith) on SAGAFTRA Television Agreement programs on and after July 1, 2011 and with respect to recordings produced under this Code and broadcast on and after July 1, 2011, the Producer shall pay to the AFTRA Health and Retirement Funds a sum equal to sixteen and one-half percent (16.5\%) (seventeen percent (17\%) effective July 1, 2015) of the gross compensation due each performer for such services and/or the use of such recordings.

Producer's obligation to make health and retirement contributions on gross compensation shall be limited to the following maximum amounts of compensation per performer per program episode on which contributions are due:

| 30 minute program episode | $\$ 15,000$ |
| :-- | :-- |
| 60 minute program episode | $\$ 24,500$ |
| 90 minute program episode | $\$ 33,000$ |
| 120 minute program episode | $\$ 40,000$ |With respect to services performed under this Code (including all services such as rehearsal theretofore performed in connection therewith) by performers on dramatic serials on or after February 27, 2012, and with respect to recordings produced under this Code and broadcast on and after February 27, 2012, the Producer shall pay to the AFTRA Health and Retirement Funds a sum equal to fifteen percent (16.5\%) (seventeen percent (17\%) effective January 1, 2015) of the gross compensation due each performer for such services and/or the use of such recordings.
B. In the event the gross compensation paid, due or to become due to a "star performer," or, on his behalf, to any other person, firm or corporation, directly or indirectly, for an engagement under this Code on or after November 16, 2004, is more than twenty-five percent ( $25 \%$ ) below the performer's reasonable or customary compensation as measured by the average gross compensation paid, due or to become due to the performer or on his behalf, to any other person, firm or corporation, directly or indirectly, by other Producers, with which performer had no relationship, for his last four (4) comparable appearances (excluding "exchanges"), then Producer shall be obligated to pay to the AFTRA Health and Retirement Funds a sum equal to the applicable percentage set forth in Paragraph 102 A of such reasonable or customary compensation, as measured by such last four (4) comparable appearances, for the instant engagement: provided, however, that the foregoing criterion of the average reasonable or customary compensation for the last four (4) comparable appearances shall in no event apply where (i) the engagement is for a type of program on which it has been customary to pay star performers minimum compensation or compensation not substantially in excess of minimum, or (ii) there has been a substantial loss in the "marquee value" of the star performer, or (iii) no last four (4) comparable appearances have occurred during the eighteen (18) month period immediately prior to the instant engagement of the performer, or (iv) the performer's engagement is only for a "flash" appearance. Upon request of Producer, SAG-AFTRA shall furnish to Producer such records as can be obtained by SAG-AFTRA as are necessary to ascertain the average gross compensation for performer's last four (4) comparable appearances.
C. As used in the preceding paragraph, a "star performer" is a performer whose average gross compensation, for an appearance under this Code, as measured by his last four (4) comparable appearances (excluding "exchanges"), is more than $\$ 1,500.00$. A "comparable appearance" is an appearance under this Code or a prior AFTRA or SAG-AFTRA Network Television Code on a comparable program. "Exchanges" are those situations where star performers exchange appearances on each other's programs.
D. The aforementioned sums shall be used solely (1) for the purpose of providing retirement benefits for eligible employees under this Code including, in the discretion of the Trustees, death benefits for beneficiaries of deceased eligible employees, (2) for the purpose of providing health benefits for eligible employees under this Code and, at the discretion of the Trustees, for eligible performers within SAG-AFTRA's jurisdiction and, at the further discretion of the Trustees, for their families, and (3) for the incidental expenses connected with the establishment and administration of the AFTRA Health and Retirement Funds.
E. Nothing in this Code shall be construed as suspending or modifying the prior AFTRA Code Health and Retirement provisions applicable to services performed or recordings broadcast from November 16, 1956 to and including November 15, 2007 nor shall this Code be construed as requiring any duplication of payment made under such prior AFTRA Code Health and Retirement provisions.
F. With respect to any agreement for the services of a performer (f/s/o agreement), including services covered by the SAG-AFTRA National Code of Fair Practice forNetwork Television Broadcasting, to be furnished by a "loan-out company" (i.e., a corporation which is controlled by the performer and which furnishes performer's services to others under an $\mathrm{f} / \mathrm{s} / \mathrm{o}$ agreement), payments into the AFTRA Health and Retirement Fund (hereinafter "contributions") shall be governed by the following:
(1) In its $\mathrm{f} / \mathrm{s} / \mathrm{o}$ agreement with the loan-out company, the Producer shall separately state the compensation applicable to services covered by the SAG-AFTRA National Code of Fair Practice for Network Television Broadcasting.
(2) If other than SAG-AFTRA covered services are involved and an amount is allocated to such other services, the Producer shall notify SAG-AFTRA of the amount allocated to the SAG-AFTRA covered services. If SAGAFTRA disputes the amount allocated to the SAG-AFTRA covered services, the parties will discuss what the appropriate allocation of such compensation shall be, giving substantial consideration in resolving the dispute to the performer's "customary salary." If, after such discussions, SAG-AFTRA does not agree on the appropriate allocation, then either party may submit the matter, as it relates to health and retirement contributions only, to arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Code.
(3) Contributions shall be based on the amount the Producer pays the loan-out company for furnishing the performer's SAG-AFTRA covered services.
(4) (a) Agreements with loan-out companies for covered services of the loaned-out performer which are entered into, on or after December 25, 1989, shall provide that Producer shall make health and retirement contributions directly to the Plan as agent for this purpose for the loan-out company.
(b) Until such time as the Producer implements the direct payment system described in subparagraph (4)(a) above, the loan-out company shall have the obligation to make the contributions; provided, however, that the Producer and the loan-out company may enter into an agreement which provides that the Producer shall pay such contributions directly, to the AFTRA Health and Retirement Fund and notify the SAG-AFTRA National Executive Director of such agreement and such payment shall be made by Producer without notice from SAG-AFTRA or the Fund. If the loan-out company does not pay contributions within ten (10) business days following the date they become due, SAG-AFTRA or the Plan shall give written notice to the Producer within a reasonable period thereafter and the Producer, as agent for this purpose for the loanout company, shall pay the contributions within ten (10) business days after receiving such notice.

# Section 2. 

The AFTRA Health and Retirement Funds shall be Trust Funds and shall be administered under the AFTRA Health and Retirement Funds Agreement and Declaration of Trust, dated November 16, 1954, as amended to date (the "Trust Agreement") which Trust Agreement is hereby ratified and confirmed, and is made a part of this Code with the same force and effect as though fully set forth herein. The said Trust Agreement shall provide, among other things:
A. That the AFTRA Health and Retirement Funds be administered by ten (10) Producer Trustees designated by the Producers and ten (10) SAG-AFTRA Trustees designated by SAG-AFTRA.
B. That SAG-AFTRA may, at any time in its discretion on written notice to all the Trustees then in office, appoint a successor or successors for any one (1) or more of the SAG-AFTRA Trustees. The written notice shall contain the names of thenew Trustees and the names of the Trustees whom they replace. Successors for Producer Trustees may be appointed as provided in the Trust Agreement.
C. That the Trustees shall determine the form, nature, and amount of retirement and health benefits and the rules of eligibility for such benefits, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. The health benefits shall include in the discretion of the Trustees any one or more of the following benefits (but none other): death, accidental death, dismemberment, hospitalization, surgical expense, medical expense, temporary disability, dental, wellness, prescription drug, loss of voice.
D. That the employers having other collective bargaining agreements with SAGAFTRA or AFTRA may, with the approval of the Trustees, become contributing Producers and parties to the Trust Agreement; and by agreeing to be bound by the Trust Agreement, such other Producers thereby appoint as their representatives in the administration of the AFTRA Health and Retirement Funds the Producer Trustees.
E. That the plan of retirement benefits adopted thereunder shall be subject to the approval of the Internal Revenue Service as a qualified plan. If any part of the plan is not approved by the Internal Revenue Service, the plan shall be modified by the Trustees, but subject to the limitations set forth in this agreement, to such form as is approved by the Internal Revenue Service.
F. That no portion of the contribution may be paid or revert to any Producer.

# Section 3. 

Each Producer shall furnish the Trustees the information pertaining to the names, job classifications, social security numbers and compensation information for all performers covered by this Agreement, together with such other information as may be reasonably required for the proper, low cost and efficient administration of the AFTRA Health and Retirement Funds. Producer agrees to furnish a remittance report containing such information and to pay to the appropriate AFTRA Health and Retirement Fund office the contribution specified in Section 1 not later than fifteen (15) days following the Thursday (a) after the week during which the performance shall have taken place, or (b) in the case of a prerecorded program after the final rendition of physical services.

## Section 4.

These provisions for the AFTRA Health and Retirement Funds are in addition to (and not in substitution in whole or in part for) any existing health and/or retirement funds covering any of the performers under this Agreement; and no performer shall lose, in whole or in part, any of his rights or privileges under such other health and/or retirement funds by virtue of receiving or being entitled to receive benefits under the AFTRA Health and Retirement Funds; nor may any payments, rights or privileges available to a performer under the AFTRA Health and Retirement Funds be credited to any payments, rights, or privileges under any other health and/or retirement funds and vice versa. Nothing in this Paragraph 102 shall preclude the AFTRA Health Fund from applying coordination of benefits and/or subrogation provisions. Nothing in this Paragraph 102 shall preclude actions to comply with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to qualified retirement plans.

## Section 5.

No part of the Producer's contributions or the performer's benefits from the Health and Retirement Plans (a) may be credited against the performer's overscale compensation or against any other benefits or emoluments whatsoever that the performer may be entitled to, no matter what form such other benefits or emoluments may take, or (b) are subject to any talent agency commission, or other deduction, except to the extent that the payment or benefits may be subject to a qualified domestic relations order or other offset or deduction required by law.# 102.A. AFTRA INDUSTRY COOPERATIVE FUND 

The AFTRA Industry Cooperative Fund proceeds are earmarked for the administration of programs intended to benefit performers and to increase awareness of the provisions of the Code.

Funding shall be provided by an employer contribution of one-tenth (1/10) of one percent $(.1 \%)$ of "gross compensation," as defined in Paragraph 102, Section 1, of this Agreement and subject to the ceilings set forth in Paragraph 102, paid to performers covered under this Agreement.

## 103. EXCESS FEEDS TO STRUCK STATIONS

Producer agrees that in the event SAG-AFTRA performers performing on a station or stations other than the originating stations of New York, Chicago and Los Angeles are on strike, the Producer will not (without the consent of SAG-AFTRA) require performers to render services on programs originating at the producer's station or facilities in excess of the number of programs originating at such points which are normally made available to such stations where such excess broadcasting is designed to replace or supplement broadcasts which would, in the absence of such strike, be of local origination at the station where such strike exists. The Producer further agrees that he will not require SAG-AFTRA members to perform services for any broadcast station and/or network for the purpose of discharging the functions of persons employed by such broadcast stations and/or network during a labor-management dispute involving such persons.

## 104. SIMULCASTS

Radio simulcasts for all programs other than sporting events shall be included under Exhibit D of the Code, pursuant to which the Producer shall pay the performers on a dramatic program simulcast on radio $6 \%$, and on all other programs $3.6 \%$ ( $1.5 \%$ where the off-camera announcer is the only covered performer) of Distributor's gross receipts in lieu of any other fees.

This provision will not be utilized in connection with the simulcast of sporting events, for which the following shall apply: Performers whose performance is simulcast shall receive no less than the applicable minimum television scale under this Code plus the applicable minimum radio scale (including one (1) hour of rehearsal if required under the Radio Code) under the applicable AFTRA or SAG-AFTRA National Code of Fair Practice for Commercial Radio Broadcasting, where the radio broadcast is commercial, or the applicable minimum radio scale set forth in Paragraph 76 of the applicable AFTRA or SAG-AFTRA National Sustaining Radio Agreement, where the radio broadcast is sustaining. The hours of rehearsal referred to herein shall be available to the Producer for use. It may be used without reference to the television minimum call if it is used for radio purposes only. A broadcast shall be deemed to be a simulcast if one (1) performance of that broadcast is used for both radio and television broadcasts, whether or not the radio and television broadcasts of that performance are actually simultaneous. Except as otherwise specified herein, all provisions of the said AFTRA or SAG-AFTRA Codes shall be applicable to simulcasts.

## Exhibit attached to and made a part of the SAG-AFTRA National Code of Fair Practice for Network Television Broadcasting

A producer who signs the 2014-2018 SAG-AFTRA National Code of Fair Practice for Network Television Broadcasting or a Letter of Adherence thereto agrees to the special terms and conditions set forth in Exhibit A in the employment of performers (as specified herein below) in network dramatic television programs produced for prime time, as defined or permitted by the FCC, as well as programs produced for the CW, which series commenced production produced prior to July 1, 2014. For all new series whose initial production commenced on or after July 1, 2014, the provisions of the SAG-AFTRA Television Agreement and Basic Codified Agreement shall apply, as set forth in such Agreements.

It is understood that this Exhibit A applies only to network prime time dramatic programs (including situation comedies) produced prior to July 1, 2014 and to programs produced for the CW and not to variety or other programs and not to "book musicals" which have a primary music emphasis. It applies to actors, background actors, singers, dancers, stuntpersons, stunt coordinators, puppeteers and airplane pilots performing on such dramatic programs, including actors who, incidental to their dramatic performance, also sing or dance. Except as specifically noted, this Exhibit A does not apply to announcers; the SAG-AFTRA Code of Fair Practice for Network Television Broadcasting in its entirety shall apply to all such persons employed on such prime time dramatic programs. The five-line-or-less rate shall not be used on dramatic programs produced under this Exhibit A. Except as otherwise provided in the background actors' provisions of this Exhibit A, actors who speak any lines are paid the full actor rates. Off-camera singers performing in standard non-commercial billboards, and standard non-commercial openings, closings, lead-ins to and lead-outs from commercials, bridging lines and musical signatures (theme songs) intended for use with three (3) or more episodes of a designated series of dramatic programs shall be paid pursuant to Exhibit A.

## TRANSFER OF RIGHTS

Upon the sale, transfer, assignment, license, lease, agreement to distribute or other disposition by Producer of its television rights in any recorded program produced by it under this Code entered into or renewed after November 16, 2011 Producer shall not be responsible to SAGAFTRA or to any performers for any payments thereafter due with respect to replays, reruns, Supplemental Markets Use or foreign telecasting or for a breach or violation of this Code by such transferee, (including distributor), if SAG-AFTRA approves the financial responsibility of such transferee in writing, and if Producer in its agreement with such transferee has included a provision (hereinafter referred to as an "assumption agreement") substantially in the following form:
(insert name of transferee)
hereby agrees with
(insert name of Producer)
that all recorded programs covered by this agreement are subject to the 2014-2018 SAG-AFTRA National Code of Fair Practice for Network Television Broadcasting. Transferee hereby agrees for the benefit of SAG-AFTRA as representative of the performers affected thereby to make the additional compensation payments subsequently incurred and required by said Code for replays, reruns, Supplemental Markets Use, or foreign telecasting, and all Social Security withholding, unemployment insurance and disability insurance payments and any other payments required of employers by law with respect to such additional compensation, and all appropriate contributions to the AFTRA Health and Retirement Funds required under the provisions of said Code with respect to such additional compensation, and to comply with the provisions of said Code with respect to the use of such recorded programs and required records and reports. It is expressly understood and agreed that the rights of transferee to telecast such recorded programs shall be subject to and conditioned upon the prompt payment to the performers involved of additional compensation as provided in said Code, and SAG-AFTRA shall be entitled to injunctive relief, in the event such payments are not made. It is also expressly understood and agreed that any dispute between the transferee and SAG-AFTRA or between the transferee and any performer whose services are covered by this assumption agreement, involving the performance or interpretation of this assumption agreement, shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 95 of said Code."

Producer agrees to give written notice to SAG-AFTRA within thirty (30) days of each sale, transfer or assignment, license or other disposition of any recorded programs which are subject to this Code, and such notice shall specify the name and address of the purchaser, licensee, transferee or assignee, and to deliver to SAG-AFTRA a copy of the above referred to assumption agreement.

An inadvertent failure on the part of Producer to comply with any of the provisions of this Exhibit B shall in no event constitute a default by Producer or a breach of the 2014-2018 SAGAFTRA National Code of Fair Practice for Network Television Broadcasting provided that such failure is cured promptly after notice thereof from SAG-AFTRA.

Upon delivery of such assumption agreement and on condition that SAG-AFTRA approves in writing the financial responsibility of the purchaser, assignee, licensee, or transferee, Producer shall not be further liable for the keeping of any such records or for the payment of such additional compensation for replays, reruns, Supplemental Markets Use, or foreign telecasting, or for contributions to the AFTRA Health and Retirement Funds which are required in connection therewith, it being agreed that the purchaser, assignee, licensee, or transferee, shall solely be liable therefor.

SAG-AFTRA agrees that it will not unreasonably withhold its approval of the financial responsibility of any such purchaser, assignee, licensee or transferee, it being further agreed that if SAG-AFTRA, within twenty-one (21) days of receipt of notice of any such sale, assignment, license or transfer, has not advised Producer that it disapproves the financial responsibility of suchpurchaser, assignee, licensee or transferee, SAG-AFTRA will be deemed to have approved the financial responsibility thereof. In the event SAG-AFTRA advises Producer within such twentyone (21) day period that it disapproves the financial responsibility of any such purchaser, assignee, licensee, or transferee and Producer disputes such disapproval, Producer shall have the right, at its election, to cause to be immediately submitted to arbitration, pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph 95 of such Code, the issue of whether SAG-AFTRA has unreasonably withheld the approval of the financial responsibility of such purchaser, assignee, licensee or transferee.

The provisions of this Exhibit B shall not apply with respect to any performer in connection with a replay, rerun, Supplemental Markets Use, or foreign telecast of a recorded program if no part of the performer's performance is used in the replay, rerun, or foreign telecast.# EXHIBIT C 

Exhibit C, Cost of Living Adjustment, was deleted from the 1991-1994 Code.
Remaining Exhibits will retain their existing letters.# EXHIBIT D 

As of November 16, 2001
Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists

Gentlemen:
The following sets forth our understanding and agreement with respect to television programs produced under the SAG-AFTRA National Code of Fair Practice for Network Television Broadcasting (the SAG-AFTRA Network Television Broadcasting Code) or a local AFTRA or SAG-AFTRA Television Broadcasting Code, which are released in Supplemental Markets.

## 1. Scope of Agreement

This agreement shall apply to television programs produced under this or any previous AFTRA or SAG-AFTRA Network Television Broadcasting Code or a local AFTRA or SAG-AFTRA Television Broadcasting Code (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "programs") which are released in Supplemental Markets. The rights of Producer in television programs produced under such Codes shall include the right to exhibit such programs in Supplemental Markets (as hereinafter defined) without the Performer's consent subject to any restrictions contained in individual employment contracts of performers in such television programs. However, in the case of a television program(s) produced on or after November 16, 1973, Producer must obtain performer's consent for release of programs to supplemental markets if the performer, as of December 1994, was:
A. involved in active negotiations regarding consent for such use, and/or
B. the Performer has subsequent to November 15, 1993 and prior to December 19, 1994 specifically denied consent to such Supplemental Market use. Such negotiation and denial of consent must be substantiated by the submission of evidentiary material, and, in any event, all restrictions (other than those contained in individual employment contracts) on post-1973 Supplemental Market use expire on November 15, 1995.

## 2. Definition of Supplemental Markets

The term "Supplemental Markets," as used in this Agreement, means only: The exhibition of television programs by means of cassettes (to the limited extent provided in subparagraph A. of this paragraph), Pay Television, or Basic Cable as those terms are hereafter defined in this paragraph, the exhibition of television programs on any commercial or common carrier such as but not limited to, commercial airlines, trains, ships and buses (referred to herein as "In-Flight") and Radio simulcasts as defined in Paragraph 104 herein. As used in this Agreement, Supplemental Markets does not include: (i) Distribution of such programs for direct projection or closed circuit exhibition before nonpaying audiences (but excluding any form of CATV) under arrangements which are covered by the existing Letter Agreement between Producer and SAG-AFTRA, or (ii) distribution of the type described in Paragraph 73.H. of the SAG-AFTRA Network Television Broadcasting Code, or of any corresponding provision in a local AFTRA or SAG-AFTRA Television Broadcasting Code.
A. Cassettes:

For the purpose of this Agreement, a cassette is any audio-visual device, including without limitation, cassette, cartridge, disc, phonogram or any other similar or dissimilar audio-visual device now known or hereafter devised, containing a program (recorded on film, disc, tapes or other material) which may be used for exhibition on a home-type television screen. The sale or rental of cassettes for exhibition on a home-type screen in the home or in other closed circuit use such as in hotel rooms constitutes the "Supplemental Market" for the purpose of thisagreement. The foregoing definition does not include the exhibition of a television program by cassette over a television broadcast station or in theatrical exhibition, and no rights to so use are granted to Producer by reason of such exclusion.

# B. Pay Television: 

"Pay Television" (also known as Pay Cable), as used in this Agreement, means exhibition on a home-type television screen by means of telecast, cable, closed circuit or CATV where substantially all systems to which the program is licensed meet the following tests:
(1) Where a separate channel is provided for which the subscriber pays a separate fee (which fee is a major charge relative to other charges made to the subscriber) for that channel; and/or
(2) Where the subscriber pays for each program he selects (except that a program he selects for which only a token charge is made shall not be considered a Pay Television program); and/or
(3) Where the subscriber pays a fee for an encoded telecast or telecast which fee is a major charge relative to other fees paid for encoded telecasts.

It is expressly understood that "Pay Television" does not include theatrical exhibition and does not include methods such as community antennas and community television systems when used to supplement free television transmission.
C. Basic Cable:
"Basic Cable," as used in this Agreement, means one (1) or more basic cable systems which do not meet the definition of Pay Television (as set forth in Paragraph 2.B. of this Exhibit D) and wherein the release on Basic Cable is a separate release and not part of a free television broadcast.

It is expressly understood that "Basic Cable" does not include theatrical exhibition and does not include methods such as community antennas and community television systems when used to supplement free television transmission.

## 3. Supplemental Market Fees

A. (1) As to each television program within the scope of Paragraph 1 above which was released in Supplemental Markets prior to November 16, 1988, except for network prime time dramatic programs, Producer will pay for the benefit of the performers on such program two percent ( $2 \%$ ) ( $3.6 \%$ with respect to programs for which an agreement to release the program to basic cable was entered into on or after February 28, 1995) of the Distributor's gross receipts in perpetuity (as hereinafter defined). With respect to programs released on cassette on or after November 16, 1985 the payment shall be two and fivetenths percent ( $2.5 \%$ ) of the first one million dollars ( $\$ 1,000,000.00$ ) of such Distributor's gross receipts and three percent (3\%) of such receipts thereafter. Both the two and five-tenths percent ( $2.5 \%$ ) and three percent (3\%) will increase to $3.6 \%$ with respect to cassettes for which an agreement to release a program to cassette was entered into on or after February 28, 1995. With respect to any other Supplemental Markets release on or after November 16, 1985, except in-flight which will remain at two percent (2\%), the payment shall be two percent ( $2 \%$ ) ( $3.6 \%$ with respect to programs for which an agreement to release the program to Supplemental Markets was entered into on or after February 28, 1995.) As to each television program produced prior to November 16, 1973 and released in Supplemental Markets on or after November 16, 1988, except for those released on cassettes or subject to subdivision (2) below, Producer will pay for the benefit of the performers on such program an amount equal to $3.6 \%$ of theDistributor's gross receipts in perpetuity (as hereinafter defined) which amount shall include Health and Retirement contributions. With respect to Distributor's gross receipts from the release to basic cable of free television programs produced on or after November 16, 1998, pursuant to license agreements entered into on or after November 16, 2001, said percentage shall be $3.6 \%$ plus applicable Health and Retirement contributions, in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 102A. No ICF contributions shall be due in connection with such payments. With respect to programs produced prior to November 16, 1973, which are released on cassette on or after November 16, 1988, the payment shall be four and five-tenths percent $(4.5 \%)$ of the first one million dollars ( $\$ 1,000,000.00$ ) of such Distributor's gross receipts and five and four-tenths percent ( $5.4 \%$ ) thereafter which amounts shall include Health and Retirement contributions.

Such payments shall be for the benefit of all performers on the program, except for background actors. Such payments shall be distributed pro rata to the performers on the basis of a two-to-one ratio for principal performers against other performers, however from the period of March 12, 1993 through February 28, 1995 the scale payment due each performer shall not exceed one and five-tenths percent ( $1.5 \%$ ) per performer and the scale payment due each off-camera announcer shall not exceed five-tenths of one percent $(.5 \%)$ per announcer. Performers on non-serial dramatic programs production of which commences on or after November 16, 2014, shall share in distributor's gross receipts on a pro rata basis of 3-2-1 rather than 2 to 1 . The parties agree that performers engaged under the Five Lines or Less category shall be regarded as a " 1 ".

For programs released after February 28, 1995, the above per performer limitations shall not apply. Notwithstanding the above, on news and public affairs programs, the five-tenths of one percent (.5\%) limitation shall apply to off-camera announcers only where such announcer is the only performer covered by this Code. The five-tenths of one percent (.5\%) limitation shall also apply to ten-lines-or-less, off-camera announcers on other type programs where the announcer is the only performer covered by this Code. In all other circumstances where the off-camera announcer is the only covered performer, a one and five-tenths percent (1.5\%) limitation shall apply.

Health and Retirement contributions shall be paid in addition to such payments. In the event any performer has individually negotiated with Producer an individual payment formula for such distribution, his pro-rata share shall be credited against the payment provided for in his individual contract. Distribution of the pro rata payments shall be made either directly to the performers by the Producer or to SAG-AFTRA for distribution to the performers as the parties may mutually determine.

Additionally, except as expressly provided otherwise above, a contribution based upon a percentage of the Supplemental Markets fee payable under this Paragraph 3.A.(1) shall be made to the AFTRA Health and Retirement Funds. The applicable percentage shall be the same as the percentage of gross compensation payable to the AFTRA Health and Retirement Funds under the AFTRA or SAG-AFTRA Code under which the program was produced.
(2) As to a network prime time dramatic program produced on or after July 1, 1983 which was released in Supplemental Markets prior to July 1, 1986, Producer will pay for the benefit of the performers on such program an amount equal to three and sixth-tenths percent ( $3.6 \%$ ) of the Distributor's gross receipts in perpetuity (as hereinafter defined) which amount shall include health and retirement contributions. With respect to programs produced prior to July 1, 1984 released to basic cable on or after July 1, 1989, the payment shall be $7.5 \%$ of the Distributor's gross receipts inperpetuity which amount shall include health and retirement contributions. With respect to programs produced on or after July 1, 1984, released to basic cable on or after July 1, 1989, the payment shall be six percent (6\%) of the Distributor's gross receipts in perpetuity which amount shall include health and retirement contributions. With respect to Distributor's gross receipts from the release to basic cable of free television programs produced on or after July 1, 1998, pursuant to license agreements entered into on or after July 1, 2001, said percentage shall be six percent (6\%) plus applicable health and retirement contributions in accordance with provisions of Paragraph 102 of this Agreement.

With respect to prime time dramatic programs produced on or after November 16, 1973, released on cassette on or after July 1, 1986 the payment shall be four and five-tenths percent $(4.5 \%)$ of the first one million dollars $(\$ 1,000,000)$ of such Distributor's gross receipts and five and four-tenths percent ( $5.4 \%$ ) thereafter. With respect to any other Supplemental Markets release of such prime time dramatic programs on or after July 1, 1986, the payment shall be $3.6 \%$ of such Distributor's gross receipts. Such payments shall be for the benefit of all performers on the program, except for walk-ons and background actors. That portion of the payments which is not allocated to health and retirement contributions shall be distributed to the performers in accordance with the distribution formula set forth in subparagraph (1) above.
B. Upon the sale, transfer, assignment, license, lease, agreement to distribute or other disposition by Producer of its right to exhibit a television program in Supplemental Markets, Producer shall not be responsible to SAG-AFTRA or to any performers for any payments thereafter due with respect to Supplemental Market use or for a breach or violation of this Agreement by such transferee, if Producer in its agreement with such transferee has included a provision (hereinafter referred to as an "assumption agreement") substantially in the following form:
(insert name of transferee)
hereby agrees with $\qquad$ that all recorded
(insert name of Producer)
programs covered by this agreement are subject to the 2014-2018 SAG-AFTRA National Code of Fair Practice for Network Television Broadcasting, including Exhibit D thereof, the SAG-AFTRA Supplemental Markets Agreement. Transferee hereby agrees expressly for the benefit of SAG-AFTRA as representative of the performers affected thereby to make the additional compensation payments for Supplemental Markets use subsequently incurred and required by said Agreement and all Social Security, withholding, unemployment insurance and disability insurance payments and other payments required of employers by law with respect to such additional compensation, and all appropriate contributions to the AFTRA Health and Retirement Funds required under the provisions of said Agreement with respect to such additional compensation, and to comply with the provisions of said Agreement with respect to the use of such recorded programs and required records and reports. It is expressly understood and agreed that the rights of transferee to exhibit such recorded programs in Supplemental Markets shall be subject to and conditioned upon the prompt payment to the performers involved of additional compensation as provided in said Agreement, and SAG-AFTRA shall be entitled to injunctive relief in the event such payments are not made. It is also expressly understood and agreed that any dispute between the transferee and SAG-AFTRA or between the transferee and any performer whose services are covered by this assumption agreement, involving the performance or interpretation of this assumption agreement, shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 95 of said Code."A. With respect to network prime time dramatic programs released on cassette on or after July 1, 1986 and all other programs released on cassette on or after November 16, 1985, the "Distributor's gross receipts" is defined as follows:
(1) If the Producer is the Distributor or the Distributor is owned by or affiliated with the Producer, the "Distributor's gross receipts" derived from the distribution of such program by "cassettes" shall be twenty percent (20\%) of the worldwide wholesale receipts derived by the Distributor. In such cases, if the Distributor is also the retailer, a reasonable allocation of the retail gross receipts shall be made as between the Distributor as distributor and the Distributor as retailer, and twenty percent (20\%) of the former only shall be deemed to be "Distributor's gross receipts." The reasonableness of such allocation shall be subject to arbitration, and in such arbitration, generally prevailing trade practices in the cassette industry with respect to dealings between non-related companies shall be relevant evidence.
(2) If the Distributor is not the Producer and is not owned by or affiliated with the Producer, the "Distributor's gross receipts" shall be one hundred percent (100\%) of the fees received by the Producer from licensing the right to distribute such program by cassette.
B. For all other purposes the term "Distributor's gross receipts" shall mean the worldwide total gross receipts derived by the distributor (who may be the Producer or a distributor licensed by the Producer) from licensing the right to exhibit such program in Supplemental Markets, as defined above.

If the distributor of such program does not distribute such program directly in Supplemental Markets, but employs a sub-distributor to so distribute such program, then the "Distributor's gross receipts" shall be the worldwide total gross receipts derived by such sub-distributor from licensing the right to exhibit such picture in Supplemental Markets. In case of an outright sale of Supplemental Markets distribution rights, for the entire world, or any territory or country, the income derived by the seller from such sale, but not the income realized by the purchaser or licensee of such rights, shall be the "Distributor's gross receipts." If any such outright sale shall include Supplemental Market exhibition rights and other rights, then (but only for the purpose of the computation required hereunder) the Producer shall allocate to the Supplemental Markets exhibition rights a fair and reasonable portion of the sales price which shall, for the purpose hereof, be the "Distributor's gross receipts." In reaching this determination, Producer may consider the current market value of Supplemental Markets exhibition rights in comparable programs.

If SAG-AFTRA shall contend that the amount so allocated was not fair and reasonable, such claim may be determined by submission to arbitration as herein provided; and in the event the Arbitrator shall find that such allocation was not reasonable and fair, he or she shall determine the fair and reasonable amount to be allocated. If the outright sale includes Supplemental Markets distribution rights to more than one (1) program, Producer shall likewise allocate to each such program a fair and reasonable portion of the sales price of the Supplemental Market rights; and if SAG-AFTRA contends that such allocation is not fair and reasonable, the question may be determined by submission to arbitration as provided herein. If the Arbitrator shall find that such allocation was not fair and reasonable, the Arbitrator shall determine the fair and reasonable amount to be so allocated to each such program. Nothing with respect to the price received on the outright sale of only Supplemental Markets distribution rights in a single such program shall be subject to arbitration except that, in the event of a dispute, there may be arbitrated the question of whether the price reported by the Producer to SAG-AFTRA as having been received by the Producer on such outright sale is less than the amount actually received by the Producer on such outright sale.
C. The Distributor's gross receipts shall not include:(1) Sums realized or held by way of deposit as security, until and unless earned, other than such sums as are non-returnable;
(2) Rebates, credits or repayments for cassettes returned (and in this connection Producer shall have the right to set up a reasonable reserve for returns);
(3) Sums required to be paid or withheld as taxes, in the nature of turnover taxes, sales taxes or similar taxes based on the actual receipts of such programs or on any monies to be remitted to or by Producer or such other distributor; but there shall not be excluded from Distributor's gross receipts any net income tax, franchise tax or excess profit tax or similar tax payable by Producer or such Distributor on its net income or for the privilege of doing business;
(4) Frozen foreign currency until Producer shall either have the right to freely use such foreign currency, or Producer or Distributor has the right to transmit to the United States to Producer or Distributor such foreign currency from the country or territory where it is frozen. If such currency may be utilized or transmitted as aforesaid, it shall be deemed to have been converted to United States dollars at the rate of exchange at which such currency was actually transmitted to the United States as aforesaid, or if not actually transmitted, then at the prevailing free market rate of exchange at the time such right to use or to transmit occurs. Frozen foreign currency shall be deemed to be unblocked on the basis of "first in, first out" unless otherwise allocated by local foreign fiscal authorities. Allocation of such unblocked funds as between revenue which serves as the basis of determining payments hereunder and other revenue, shall be on a proportional basis, subject to different earmarking by local foreign fiscal authorities.

# D. Allocation of Gross Receipts: 

If any agreement for distribution in the Supplemental Market includes more than one program, or includes both Supplemental Market rights and other rights, Producer shall make a reasonable allocation for the purpose of determining payments due hereunder. If SAG-AFTRA contends that such allocation is not reasonable, then such claim may be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the Voluntary Labor Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.

## 5. Time of Payment and Reports

Payments of any Supplemental Market fees due under this agreement shall be made quarterly on the basis of quarterly statements. Payments shall continue as long as gross receipts are realized from the distribution. Producer shall furnish to SAG-AFTRA written quarterly reports showing Producer's gross receipts, in accordance with the foregoing, from distribution of programs in Supplemental Markets. SAG-AFTRA shall have the right, at reasonable times, to examine the books and records of Producer insofar as they relate to Producer's gross receipts from distribution in Supplemental Markets.

Producer shall furnish to SAG-AFTRA, promptly upon the release of any program to Supplemental Markets, information including the name, length and date of production of the program and a complete program cast list of performers covered by this Agreement, their social security numbers and a description of the services rendered by each.

Within a reasonable time after the expiration of each calendar quarter but not exceeding sixty (60) days, Producer will furnish or cause to be furnished to SAG-AFTRA, a written report showing the gross receipts during the preceding quarter, from the distribution of each such television program by Producer in Supplemental Markets with respect to which Producer is required to make payments hereunder (whether distributed by the Producer or through another Distributor), showing the date of first exhibition in any Supplemental Market, and concurrently with the furnishing of such written report, Producer shall make the payment thereby shown to be due. If the Producer shall fail to pay such additionalcompensation when and as the same becomes due and payable, the Producer shall pay a late payment penalty of one and one-half percent ( $11 / 2 \%$ ) per month on the unpaid balance commencing to accrue from the date of the delinquency.

No such reports need be furnished with respect to any periods during which there were no such gross receipts. An inadvertent failure to comply with the reporting provisions of this subsection shall not constitute a default by the Producer hereunder, provided such failure is cured promptly after notice thereof is received by the Producer from SAG-AFTRA.
6. Assignment of Rights

It is agreed that the rights of performers to compensation for the Supplemental Markets use of a program in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall not be affected by any sale, assignment, pledge, hypothecation, or other transfer of the recording of the program, or by any attachment, garnishment, bankruptcy, assignments for the benefit of creditors, probate, or any other legal proceeding involving the Producer or his successors in interest. Accordingly, it is expressly agreed that the right of any Producer hereunder to use a recording of any program pursuant to this Agreement is subject to the condition precedent of the payment of all fees required by this Agreement and that:
A. Any person acquiring all or part of the property rights of said Producer in such recording by voluntary assignment shall do so subject to the same conditions precedent; and
B. In the event of any involuntary assignment, whether by operation of law or otherwise, the Producer's rights in such recording shall be deemed personal and non-assignable, and no assignee thereof shall acquire any right to use such recording; provided, however, that SAG-AFTRA agrees to permit the assignee in the event of an involuntary assignment, whether by operation of law or otherwise, to exercise all rights hereunder upon payment to the SAG-AFTRA performers in the program of all fees that may be due or become due to them hereunder; and further, that the assignee shall be deemed to have full title to said recording upon his executing an agreement with SAG-AFTRA whereby said assignee assumes the obligation of the debtor to the SAG-AFTRA performers. Producer agrees to incorporate the terms of this paragraph in any transfer of his interest in a recording and to require the same undertaking on behalf of his successors and assigns in interest.
C. The performer shall have the right to apply for and secure an injunction against any Supplemental Market use of a program containing the performer's services in the event the requirements of this agreement are not satisfied, and more particularly in the event all payments provided for herein (or in the performer's agreement with the Producer) are not made.

# 7. Prior AFTRA Codes and Agreements 

Except to the extent that prior Codes have been modified by this Code, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to vary the terms, provisions, and conditions of any agreement in force as of June 18, 1989 and which concerns the release of a program(s) produced prior to November 16, 1973 in Supplemental Markets.
8. Availability of Agreement

This Agreement shall be available to any Producer which produces television programs within the scope of agreement set forth in Paragraph 1 which are released in Supplemental Markets, and except as set forth herein no Producer has any rights whatsoever to use in Supplemental Markets any program heretofore produced under an AFTRA or SAGAFTRA Network Television Code or Local Television Contract.
9. Term of AgreementThis Agreement shall be effective on the date of execution hereof and shall be coterminous with the 2014-2018 SAG-AFTRA Network Television Broadcasting Code.

(4) Producer agrees that prior to the employment of any performer in an entertainment program of the type historically produced under the SAGAFTRA Code intended primarily for exhibition on Pay Television which is not described in subparagraphs (1) through (3) above, Producer will give at least sixty (60) days' advance notice to SAG-AFTRA of such proposed employment. Producer and SAG-AFTRA agree to meet within thirty (30) days from receipt of such notice for the purpose of negotiating with respect to the terms and conditions for such employment. If no agreement is reached with respect thereto within such sixty (60) day period, SAGAFTRA may, upon a thirty (30) day written notice to Producer, instruct its members to withhold services with respect to the production of such program. Any dispute between SAG-AFTRA and the Producer as to whether such program is included in one of the categories described in subparagraphs (1) through (3) above shall be subject to arbitration under the provisions of this Exhibit E.
B. The initial compensation set forth in this Paragraph 2 shall constitute payment in full for ten (10) exhibition days for a program (with no limit on the number of broadcasts commenced in any calendar day) over a single United States national pay television subscription service to which the program is licensed in the Pay Television Market within a period of one (1) year from the initial exhibition on each such service and for ten (10) exhibition days for a program (with no limit on the number of broadcasts commenced in any calendar day) over all other services in the United States and Canada to which the program is licensed in the Pay Television market within a period of one (1) year from the initial exhibition on such service.

C. The parties recognize that the March 25, 1982 Supplement to the 1980-1983 AFTRA Code of Fair Practice for Phonograph Recordings and its successors may cover categories of programs not described in Paragraph 2.A. above and that nothing herein shall preclude any signatory hereof from producing such programs pursuant to such Codes.A. Pay Television - For covered programs released in the Pay Television Market:
(1) For exhibition days on a single United States national pay television subscription service or any other service in the United States and Canada, either in excess of ten (10) or subsequent to one (1) year from the date of the initial exhibition on such service, or for exhibitions on foreign (i.e., other than the United States and Canada) pay television, or for exhibitions on a second or subsequent United States national pay television subscription service, Producer shall pay:

Six percent (6\%) (plus Health and Retirement payments in accordance with the 2014-2018 SAG-AFTRA Code) of the Distributor's gross receipts as defined in Exhibit D of the 2001-2004 AFTRA Code from such excess exhibition days on such service, except that in the case of covered programs the cast of which (exclusive of those members of the cast who would not be entitled to residuals if the program had been produced for free television) is four (4) performers or less, the total percentage shall be computed on the basis of one and one-half percent ( $11 / 2 \%$ ) per performer. The computation of the number of performers in the cast, for purposes of determining the percentage payable, shall exclude off-camera announcers, provided however, that where the only performer(s) on a program is an off-camera announcer(s), the percentage shall be one-half ( $1 / 2$ ) of one percent ( $1 \%$ ) plus pension and welfare. However, off-camera announcers shall not be excluded for purposes of determining the rateable distribution provided in Exhibit E, Paragraph 5 hereof.
(2) If any license, whether an initial or subsequent license, for a program on any service covers exhibition days in excess of ten (10), each such day shall be given equal monetary weight in determining the sums subject to the payment described in subparagraph (1) hereof. As an example, if the initial license encompasses seventeen (17) exhibition days, $7 / 17^{\text {th }}$ of the sums actually received from such license shall be subject to the appropriate payment under this Paragraph 3. For further example, if a second or subsequent license is for ten (10) days and covers the ninth ( $9^{\text {th }}$ ) through eighteenth $\left(18^{\text {th }}\right)$ day, $8 / 10^{\text {th }}$ of the sum actually received from such licenses shall be subject to the appropriate payment under this Paragraph 3.
(3) Where a license covers exhibition days both within and outside the one (1) year limitation set forth in Paragraph 2.B. above, all days shall be given equal monetary weight. For example, if a license is for fourteen (14) days use in eighteen (18) months, and five (5) exhibition days occur after the one (1) year period, each day of exhibition which actually occurs after the one (1) year period shall be given equal monetary weight, and $5 / 14^{\text {ths }}$ of the license fee shall be subject to the appropriate payment under this Exhibit E, Paragraph 3.
(4) The Producer's right to apply contingent compensation against the payments required to be paid to any performer under the 2014-2018 SAG-AFTRA Code shall also apply to any payments required herein.
(5) Payment shall be made quarterly.# B. Video Disc/Videocassette Market 

(1) For sales of a covered program in the video disc/videocassette market, the Producer shall pay:

Six percent (6\%) (plus Health and Retirement payments in accordance with the 2014-2018 SAG-AFTRA Network Television Code) of the fee or other payment actually received by the Producer from net unit sales in excess of 100,000 units in the aggregate, except that in the case of covered programs the cast of which (exclusive of those members of the cast who would not be entitled to residuals if the program had been produced for network television) is four (4) performers or less, the total percentage shall be computed on the basis of one and one-half percent ( $11 / 2 \%$ ) per performer. The computation of the number of performers in the cast, for purposes of this paragraph only (but not for the purpose of determining rateable distribution provided in Paragraph 5 hereof), shall exclude off-camera announcer(s), provided however, that where the only performer(s) on a program is an off-camera announcer(s), the percentage shall be one-half $(1 / 2)$ of one percent $(.5 \%)$ plus pension and welfare.
(2) The term "disc" as used in this paragraph shall refer to both video discs and videocassettes. The term "unit" shall refer to the disc or aggregate discs in each package released by the Producer for sale or rental. "Net Unit Sales" shall mean sales of units which are released by the Producer or its distributor for sale and are not returned, or are released by the Producer or its distributor for rental purposes.
(3) It is recognized that some companies hereunder may act both as producers and as distributors of disc units in covered sales. In such a case, the payments set forth above shall be based on either (i) the fee or other payment received by the subsidiary, division or other department of the company which serves as the production branch from the subsidiary, division or other department of the company which serves as the distribution branch, or (ii) where no separate subsidiary, division, or other department serves as the production branch, a reasonable allocation of the gross receipts of the company from covered sales attributable solely to fees or other payments which would be made to a production subsidiary, division or other department of the company if one existed, or would be made to an outside producer. The reasonableness of such allocation in (ii) above, or of the fee or other payment received by the production subsidiary, division or other department in (i) above, shall be determined in its license fee payments to outside producers for comparable disc units, or in the absence of such practice, by generally prevailing trade practice in the video disc industry.
(4) The Producer's right to apply contingent compensation against the payments required to be paid to any performer under the 2014-2018 SAG-AFTRA Code shall also apply to any payments required herein.

## TRANSFER OF RIGHTS

Upon the sale, transfer, assignment, license, lease, agreement to distribute or other disposition by Producer of its television rights in any recorded promotional announcement produced by it under this Code entered into or renewed after November 16, 2011 Producer shall not be responsible to SAG-AFTRA or to any performers for any payments thereafter due with respect to use of said promotional announcements or for a breach or violation of this Code by such transferee, (including distributor), if SAG-AFTRA approves the financial responsibility of such transferee in writing, and if Producer in its agreement with such transferee has included a provision (hereinafter referred to as an "assumption agreement") substantially in the following form:
(insert name of transferee)
hereby agrees with $\qquad$
(insert name of Producer)
that all recorded promotional announcements covered by this agreement are subject to the 20142018 SAG-AFTRA National Code of Fair Practice for Network Television Broadcasting. Transferee hereby agrees for the benefit of SAG-AFTRA as representative of the performers affected thereby to make the compensation payments incurred and required by said Code for use of said promotional announcements, and all Social Security withholding, unemployment insurance and disability insurance payments and any other payments required of employers by law with respect to such compensation, and all appropriate contributions to the AFTRA Health and Retirement Funds required under the provisions of said Code with respect to such compensation, and to comply with the provisions of said Code with respect to the use of such recorded programs and required records and reports. It is expressly understood and agreed that the rights of transferee to telecast such recorded promotional announcements shall be subject to and conditioned upon the prompt payment to the performers involved of compensation as provided in said Code, and SAGAFTRA shall be entitled to injunctive relief, in the event such payments are not made. It is also expressly understood and agreed that any dispute between the transferee and SAG-AFTRA or between the transferee and any performer whose services are covered by this assumption agreement, involving the performance or interpretation of this assumption agreement, shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 95 of said Code."

Producer agrees to give written notice to SAG-AFTRA within thirty (30) days of each sale, transfer or assignment, license or other disposition of any recorded promotional announcements which are subject to this Code, and such notice shall specify the name and address of the purchaser, licensee, transferee or assignee, and to deliver to SAG-AFTRA a copy of the above referred to assumption agreement.

An inadvertent failure on the part of Producer to comply with any of the provisions of this Exhibit J shall in no event constitute a default by Producer or a breach of the 2014-2018 SAGAFTRA National Code of Fair Practice for Network Television Broadcasting provided that such failure is cured promptly after notice thereof from SAG-AFTRA.

Upon delivery of such assumption agreement and on condition that SAG-AFTRA approves in writing the financial responsibility of the purchaser, assignee, licensee, or transferee, Producer shall not be further liable for the keeping of any such records or for the payment of such compensation or for contributions to the AFTRA Health and Retirement Funds which are required in connection therewith, it being agreed that the purchaser, assignee, licensee, or transferee, shall solely be liable therefor.

SAG-AFTRA agrees that it will not unreasonably withhold its approval of the financial responsibility of any such purchaser, assignee, licensee or transferee, it being further agreed that if SAG-AFTRA, within twenty-one (21) days of receipt of notice of any such sale, assignment, license or transfer, has not advised Producer that it disapproves the financial responsibility of suchpurchaser, assignee, licensee or transferee, SAG-AFTRA will be deemed to have approved the financial responsibility thereof. In the event SAG-AFTRA advises Producer within such twentyone (21) day period that it disapproves the financial responsibility of any such purchaser, assignee, licensee, or transferee and Producer disputes such disapproval, Producer shall have the right, at its election, to cause to be immediately submitted to arbitration, pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph 95 of such Code, the issue of whether SAG-AFTRA has unreasonably withheld the approval of the financial responsibility of such purchaser, assignee, licensee or transferee.

The provisions of this Exhibit J shall not apply with respect to any performer in connection with use of a recorded promotional announcement if no part of the performer's performance is used.# SIDELETTER 1

However, where there is no individual contract or where the individual contract does not contain a provision specifically providing for use of still photographs, SAG-AFTRA has been informed that it is the Producer's intention to pay a performer engaged on a dramatic program $\$ 25.00$ for each episode in which a still photograph(s) is used to portray a point essential to the story, provided the performer does not otherwise appear in the episode.

As of November 16, 1994
Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists

## Gentlemen:

SAG-AFTRA brought to the attention of the serial producers a number of serious concerns involving certain terms and conditions of employment of performers engaged in daytime serial production in both the studio and on remotes. Cited were such items as overtime, short turnaround, hazardous assignment, vacation schedules, and employment of minors. The producers acknowledge that these are matters of concern for them as well.

Since all of these concerns differ in their degree of applicability with respect to each producer and each serial, and because of competitive reasons, SAG-AFTRA and the Companies believe that these mutual concerns should continue to be addressed in a different forum, during the term of the contract, on a producer-by-producer basis.

Therefore, in an effort to nurture an ongoing dialogue with respect to these important matters in the period between negotiations, the parties have agreed to hold semi-annual meetings between SAG-AFTRA and each producer on a show-by-show basis. Among the broad range of topics to be addressed at each meeting are the issues referred to above in the first paragraph of this sideletter, plus any other issue of mutual concern that may arise during the period of this contract. The meetings will be held at a mutually convenient time, taking into consideration the production requirements of each program. Attending these meetings for each producer will be not only the senior production representatives for each program but also senior programming, business and labor relations executives. Attending for SAG-AFTRA will be its senior representatives at each location, and representative performers at SAG-AFTRA's discretion, provided that program requirements permit.

A meeting pursuant to this Sideletter 13 shall be scheduled not later than 120 days from the date of ratification of the new Agreement to discuss the problems of vacation scheduling.

Many of the rules and working conditions of the Code of Fair Practice for Network Television Broadcasting were first formulated at a time when most programs were produced live. SAGAFTRA and the Producers agree that, as a result of subsequent changes in the methods of production, the structure of the Code is now overly complicated.

In recognition of their mutual desire to simplify and streamline certain rules and working conditions of the Code, the parties have agreed to establish a Contract Adjustment Committee. This Committee, consisting of SAG-AFTRA representatives and Producer (including Network) representatives will meet during the term of the Agreement to discuss and consider such changes in the structure of the Code as it deems necessary to achieve these objectives including, for example, changes in provisions concerning overtime, included hours and days, additional rehearsal, guaranteed days, sessions, calls, etc.

The Contract Adjustment Committee shall have the authority to agree upon changes of this nature and to recommend changes to the Producers (including Networks) and SAG-AFTRA. If mutually approved, such changes may be implemented during the term of the Agreement.

With respect to programs intended for initial use on New Media, the parties agree as follows:

The parties recognize that the economics of New Media production are presently uncertain and greater flexibility in terms and conditions of employment is therefore beneficial.

All other promotional announcements intended for initial use in New Media may be covered under the terms of Paragraph D. at the Producer's option.

A "Derivative New Media Production" ("DNMP") is a production for New Media based on an existing television program that was produced for "traditional" media - e.g., a free television, basic cable, or pay television program (the "Original Production").

All terms and conditions of employment, including initial compensation and deferred compensation, if any, will be subject to negotiation between the Producer and the individual Performer, except for those provisions of the SAG-AFTRA Network TV Code incorporated herein by reference below. It is understood that Producer and Performer may have negotiated about such terms and conditions in contracts of employment entered into prior to March 8, 2008; if so, the terms and conditions of such contract shall control. SAG-AFTRA agrees that it will not interfere in any such negotiations between the Performer and the Producer.# 2. Applicable Provisions of the Network Code

National Executive Director# SIDELETTER ON EXHIBITION OF SAG-AFTRA NATIONAL CODE OF FAIR PRACTICE FOR NETWORK TELEVISION BROADCASTING PROGRAMS REUSED IN NEW MEDIA 

This Sideletter confirms the understanding of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists ("SAG-AFTRA") and the Producers (collectively "the parties") concerning the application of the 2014 SAG-AFTRA National Code of Fair Practice for Network Television Broadcasting ("SAG-AFTRA Code") to the exhibition of covered entertainment television programs of the type that have traditionally been produced under this or any previous AFTRA or SAG-AFTRA Code on or by means of "New Media", as that term is defined in the Sideletter on Programs made for New Media.

## 1. If the Consumer Pays.

A. License for Limited Period or Fixed Number of Exhibitions

When the subscriber pays for the program either on a subscription or per-picture basis, and when the payment is in exchange for the right to view the television program for a fixed and limited period of time or a fixed number of exhibitions, the Producer shall pay to the performer(s) an aggregate sum equal to three and sixtenths percent $(3.6 \%)$ of the license fee paid by the licensee for the right to exhibit such television program in New Media. ${ }^{1}$
B. Paid Permanent Downloads (aka "Download-to-Own" or "Electronic Sell Through" ("EST"))

The following shall apply to programs first exhibited on or after March 8, 2008:
When the consumer pays for an EST copy of a television program, the Producer shall pay residuals at the rate of $5.4 \%$ of $20 \%$ of "Distributor's gross," as defined in Paragraph 5 below, on the first 100,000 units and, thereafter, at $10.5 \%$ of $20 \%$ of "Distributor's gross," as defined in Paragraph 5 below.

Such payments shall be for the benefit of all performers on the program, except for background actors. Such payments shall be distributed pro rata to the performers on the basis of a two-to-one ratio for principal performers against other performers; the scale payment due each performer shall not exceed one and five-tenths percent $(1.5 \%)$ per performer; and the scale payment due each off-camera announcer shall not exceed five-tenths of one percent $(.5 \%)$ per announcer. Performers on non-serial dramatic programs production of which commences on or after November 16, 2014, shall share in distributor's gross receipts on a pro rata basis of 3-2-1 rather than 2 to 1 . The parties agree that performers engaged under the Five Lines or Less category shall be regarded as a " 1 ".

## 2. Advertiser-Supported Streaming

The following shall apply to the streaming of television programs on a free to the consumer basis on advertiser-supported services transmitted via New Media.
A. With respect to television programs, the production of which commences on or after November 16, 2014:

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ As bargaining history, this language is based upon the following model: studio licenses to Moviefly the right to transmit the motion picture on the Internet to the viewer who pays Moviefly on a subscription or per-picture basis. Such payment would enable the viewer to view the motion picture for a fixed and limited period of time or limited number of exhibitions. For example, if Columbia Pictures, through Columbia-TriStar Home Entertainment, licenses to Moviefly the right to exhibit a Columbia Pictures film, the residuals shall be based upon $100 \%$ of the license fee paid by Moviefly to Columbia-TriStar Home Entertainment for such picture.(1) The Producer shall be entitled to a "streaming window" for a seven (7) consecutive day period, except it shall be twenty-four (24) consecutive days for the first seven (7) episodes of a new series and any one time program; and seventeen (17) consecutive days for children's programming and daytime serials.
B. There shall also be a seven (7) consecutive day free streaming window surrounding each rerun on broadcast television of a program made for initial exhibition on broadcast television, whether produced under the 2014 Code or any prior Code, for which free television residuals are payable. The seven (7) consecutive day period shall be measured separately for each city in the United States and Canada. If the program is rerun more than once in any seven (7) consecutive day period, the free streaming window shall nevertheless be limited to a single seven (7) consecutive day period surrounding one of the runs, which shall be determined by the Producer. During the streaming window, the Producer may make a television program available for streaming without payment for such use. The streaming window may be divided between the period immediately prior to and immediately following the initial exhibition of the program on television in any ratio determined by the Producer, except that for each episode of a series in its first year, the streaming window may commence up to thirty (30) days before the initial exhibition on television of the episode.

No payment is due, if during the free streaming period windows provided above, the Producer makes available a television program, production of which commences on or after November 16, 2014, for exhibition on a free-to-theconsumer, advertiser-supported service transmitted via the internet or mobile or other device or on the advertiser-supported video-on-demand service ("AVOD") of a multichannel video programming distributor ("MVPD") or any similar service that currently exists or may hereafter be developed.
(1) If outside the streaming window, but within one (1) year of the expiration of the streaming window, the Producer makes available a television program, production of which commences on or after November 16, 2014, for exhibition on a free-to-the-consumer, advertiser-supported service transmitted via the internet or mobile or other device or on the advertisersupported video-on-demand service ("AVOD") of a multichannel video programming distributor ("MVPD") or any similar service that currently exists or may hereafter be developed, then the Producer shall make a residual payment in the following amount as consideration for a twenty-six (26) consecutive week period beginning on the first day that the television program is made available as described above following the expiration of the streaming window:
(i) In the case of dramatic programs, four percent (4\%) effective November 16, 2014, four and one-half percent (4.5\%) effective November 16, 2015, and five percent (5\%) effective November 16, 2016, of the first replay fee applicable to the television program; and
(ii) In the case of non-dramatic programs, four percent (4\%) effective November 16, 2014, four and one-half percent (4.5\%) effective November 16, 2015, and five percent (5\%) effective November 16, 2016, of the program fee applicable to the television program.
(2) If the Producer desires to make the television program available as described above for all or any part of the twenty-six (26) consecutive week period immediately following the twenty-six (26) consecutive week period described in the preceding paragraph, but within one (1) year of the expiration of the streaming window, then the Producer shall make a residual payment in the following amount as consideration for a twenty-six (26) consecutive week period beginning on the first day that the televisionprogram is made available during such twenty-six (26) consecutive week period:
(i) In the case of dramatic programs, four percent (4\%) effective November 16, 2014, four and one-half percent (4.5\%) effective November 16, 2015, and five percent (5\%) effective November 16, 2016, of the first replay fee applicable to the television program; and
(ii) In the case of non-dramatic programs, four percent (4\%) effective November 16, 2014, four and one-half percent (4.5\%) effective November 16, 2015, and five percent (5\%) effective November 16, 2016, of the program fee applicable to the television program.
(3) Neither of the aforementioned twenty-six (26) week periods shall cover a period that is more than one (1) year after the expiration of the streaming window. In the event that a television program is made available as described above on a date that does not allow for the full twenty-six (26) consecutive week period of use within one (1) year of the expiration of the streaming window, then the payment for that period shall be prorated in weekly units to cover the shorter use period.

For example, suppose that the Producer streams a television program during the window and then does not stream the program again until thirty-nine (39) weeks after the expiration of the window period. Since only thirteen (13) weeks remain within the one (1) year period, a payment of one-half of the payment that would otherwise be due for the twenty-six (26) week streaming period would be payable for streaming during the thirteen (13) week period.
(4) During the streaming window, or during either of the twenty-six (26) consecutive week periods described in Paragraph 2.A.(2) above, the Producer may allow excerpts of those television programs that are being made available to be used on free to the consumer, advertiser-supported services transmitted via New Media without any additional payment therefor.
(5) Upon expiration of the one (1) year period following expiration of the streaming window, if the Producer desires to make available a television program, production of which commences on or after November 16, 2014, for streaming on a free-to-the-consumer, advertiser-supported service transmitted via the internet or mobile or other device or on the advertisersupported video-on-demand service ("AVOD") of a multichannel video programming distributor ("MVPD") or any similar service that currently exists or may hereafter be developed, then it shall pay residuals at the rate of six percent ( $6 \%$ ) of "Distributor's gross," as that term is defined in Paragraph 5 below.
B. If the Producer should desire to stream any television program, the production of which commenced prior to March 8, 2008, as to which free television residuals are still payable, then the Producer shall pay residuals at the rate of six percent (6\%) of "Distributor's gross," as that term is defined in Paragraph 5 below.
C. Revenues derived from foreign streaming shall be included in "Distributor's Foreign Gross," as provided in Paragraph 73.F. of the SAG-AFTRA Network TV Code.
D. During the 2014 negotiations, the parties confirmed that no residuals or other payments are due when a Producer makes available on an advertiser-supported video-on-demand service ("AVOD") of a multichannel video programming distributor ("MVPD") a program produced under an agreement with SAG, AFTRA or SAG-AFTRA entered into prior to November 16, 2014.A. In addition to the use of excerpts permitted in Paragraph 2 above, Company may use an excerpt or excerpts from a television program (other than a television program ninety ( 90 ) minutes or more in length) in new media for the purpose of promoting the television program, provided that such excerpt(s) does not exceed five (5) minutes in length. Company may use an excerpt or excerpts from a television program ninety ( 90 ) minutes or more in length or from a program made for the home video market in new media for the purpose of promoting the program, provided that such excerpt(s) does not exceed ten (10) minutes in length.
B. The following uses of an excerpt or excerpts in new media shall be considered "promotional" and shall require no payment, whether or not the Company receives revenue in connection therewith:
(1) For promotion of the exhibition of a television program on free television, basic cable or pay television, the use of an excerpt shall not require compensation if the excerpt promotes the exhibition and includes "tune in" information. "Tune-in" information for promotional purposes is sufficient when it informs the consumer where he or she can view the program or series from which the excerpt is taken. The "tune-in" information may appear on-screen or in a "click-through" format - i.e., accessible through links. It is agreed that the network channel or station "bug" alone does not suffice. It is also understood that the Company is not required to provide the same level of "tune-in" information as is commonly provided in traditional network television promotional announcements.
(2) For promotion of the traditional home video release or any "special edition" home video release of a television program, the use of an excerpt shall not require compensation if the excerpt promotes the home video release and references the availability of the program in home video.
(3) For promotion of a new media exhibition of a television program, the use of an excerpt shall not require compensation if the excerpt promotes the new media exhibition and includes instructions for renting, purchasing, or streaming an electronic copy of the program from the website or other new media platform on which the excerpt appears or a direct link to another website or new media platform where an electronic copy of the program can be rented, purchased, or streamed, and occurs in conjunction with the availability of an electronic copy of the program for rental, purchase, or adsupported streaming via the Internet or other new media platform.
(4) For "viral" promotion on new media of any use or exhibition of a television program, no payment is required if the excerpt is circulated noncommercially to multiple websites or made available for individuals to circulate. The fact that the viral excerpt is exhibited on a revenuegenerating site owned by or affiliated with the Company shall not render this exception inapplicable, provided that the excerpt is released without payment to other sites.
C. The use of excerpts shall not be considered "promotional" within the meaning of subparagraph B. above if the excerpts are used on a new media site which archives the contents of several prior seasons of the series and is designed to enable the viewer to search the archives using a sophisticated search engine, as distinguished from a new media site which offers excerpts from several prior seasons of a series that are intended as a recap of the events that transpired during those prior seasons or that are intended to promote the exhibition or sale of full episodes of the series from which the excerpts are taken.D. If the use of an excerpt or excerpts in new media is not within one of the promotional provisions in subparagraph B. above, or if the excerpt(s) used exceed the length limitations set forth in subparagraph A. above:
(1) If the excerpt is from a television program and is used on a free to the consumer platform outside the streaming window, but within one year following expiration of the streaming window, and the use is not otherwise permitted or paid for under subparagraph 2.A. above, the Producer shall pay for such use as follows:
(i) For an excerpt up to two (2) minutes in length, the lesser of $\$ 25$ or the applicable "new media program fee;"
(ii) For an excerpt in excess of two (2) minutes in length but not more than four (4) minutes in length, the lesser of $\$ 75$ or the applicable "new media program fee;"
(iii) For an excerpt in excess of four (4) minutes in length, the applicable "new media program fee."

The "new media program fee" for use of excerpts on free to the consumer platforms is the applicable residual for the use of the entire program in new media as provided in Paragraph 2.A. of this Sideletter.
(2) For any other use of an excerpt from a television program on a free to the consumer platform, including the use of excerpts from a television program produced prior to March 8, 2008, the Producer shall pay six percent (6\%) of "Distributor's gross," as defined in Paragraph 5 below, for such use.
(3) If an excerpt from a television program is used on a "consumer pay" platform, the producer shall pay $3.6 \%$ of "Distributor's gross," as defined in Paragraph 5 of this Sideletter, for such use, except when the excerpt is used for one of the promotional purposes set forth in Paragraphs 3.B.(1) through (4) above and meets the length limitations in Paragraph 3.A. above. This formula shall apply to a "hybrid" use where the consumer pays for the excerpt and advertising revenues are also derived by the Producer from such use. Such revenues shall be incorporated in "Distributor's gross."
E. Notwithstanding the foregoing:
(1) If excerpts from the current season of a series and excerpts from past seasons of the series are used together on an ad-supported free to the consumer basis, then the percentage of "Distributor's gross" payment set forth in Paragraph 2.B. of this Sideletter shall apply to all such excerpts.
(2) No payment shall be required for the free to the consumer "noncommercial" promotional use of excerpts more than five (5) minutes for programs less than ninety ( 90 ) minutes in length or more than ten (10) minutes for programs ninety ( 90 ) minutes or more in length containing one (1) or more scenes. A "non-commercial" use is a use from which the Company and its related and affiliated entities, including, but not limited to, distributors and exhibitors, receive no revenues, including, but not limited to, advertising revenues.
(3) No payment shall be required for free to consumer use of excerpts during the streaming window. If the Company pays the "new media program fee" pursuant to Paragraph 2.A. of this Sideletter, the payment for the use of the entire program in new media shall also constitute payment for the free to the consumer use of any portion thereof in new media during the corresponding time period.(4) It is understood that the use of an excerpt from a television program or a made-for-home video program shall not require any payment hereunder if the use would not require a payment under the television excerpt provisions of the SAG-AFTRA TV Code.
F. All obligations of the Producer with respect to the use of an excerpt or excerpts under this Paragraph 3 shall be fully satisfied so long as the excerpt(s) meets the promotional requirements set forth herein or the Producer pays the applicable amount set forth herein.

Given the novelty and complexity of the issues regarding the promotional versus non-promotional and commercial versus non-commercial use of excerpts in New Media, the parties agree to establish a Committee to review, discuss and categorize instances of such use in New Media to assist them in refining their mutual understanding of such uses and SAG-AFTRA agrees not to file any grievances or arbitration claims arising out of or relating to a dispute over the use of excerpts in New Media that occurs during the first six months of the 2008 Agreement, provided that all payments as to which there is no bona fide dispute are timely made.

# 4. REUSE OF MADE FOR NEW MEDIA PRODUCTIONS 

## A. Derivative New Media Productions

(1) Initial compensation for a Derivative New Media Production shall constitute payment for thirteen (13) weeks of use on all free to the consumer advertiser-supported platforms transmitted via New Media (hereinafter "advertiser-supported platforms"), commencing with the first day that the Derivative New Media Production is available for exhibition on any advertiser-supported platform, and for a separate twenty-six (26) week period of use on any consumer pay new media platform (hereinafter "consumer pay platform"), commencing with the first day that the Derivative New Media Production is available for exhibition on any consumer pay platform.
(2) Use on Advertiser-Supported Platforms Within One Year Following Expiration of the Thirteen Week Period
a. If the Producer desires to use the Derivative New Media Production on advertiser-supported platforms beyond the thirteen (13) week period, but within one (1) year of the expiration of the thirteen (13) week period, then the Producer shall make a residual payment in the following amount as consideration for a twenty-six (26) consecutive week period of use, commencing with the first day that the Derivative New Media Production is available for use on any advertiser-supported platform following the expiration of the thirteen (13) week period:
(i) In the case of dramatic programs, three percent (3\%) (three and one-half percent (3.5\%) effective March 8, 2010) of the first replay fee applicable to a television program of the same length as the derivative program; and
(ii) In the case of non-dramatic programs, three percent (3\%) (three and one-half percent (3.5\%) effective March 8, 2010) of the program fee applicable to a television program of the same length as the derivative program.b. If the Producer desires to use the Derivative New Media Production on advertiser-supported platforms for all or any part of the twentysix (26) consecutive week period immediately following the twentysix (26) consecutive week period described in Paragraph 4.A(2) above, but within one (1) year after expiration of the thirteen (13) week period, then the Producer shall make a residual payment equal to the applicable amount payable under Paragraph 4.A(2) above, as consideration for a twenty-six (26) consecutive week period of use, commencing with the first day that the Derivative New Media Production is available for use during such twenty-six (26) consecutive week period.
c. Neither of the aforementioned twenty-six (26) consecutive week periods shall cover a period that is more than one (1) year after the expiration of the thirteen (13) consecutive week period. In the event that use of the television program on advertiser-supported platforms is commenced on a date that does not allow for the full twenty-six (26) consecutive week period of use within one (1) year of the expiration of the thirteen (13) consecutive week period, then the payment for that period shall be prorated in weekly units to cover the shorter use period.

For example, suppose that the Producer uses a television program on advertiser-supported platforms during the thirteen (13) consecutive week period and then does not use the program on advertiser-supported platforms again until thirty-nine (39) weeks after the expiration of the thirteen (13) consecutive week period. Since only thirteen (13) weeks remain within the one (1) year period, a payment of one-half of the payment that would otherwise be due for the twenty-six (26) consecutive week use period would be payable for use during the remaining thirteen (13) week period.

# (3) Use on Advertiser-Supported Platforms More Than One Year Following Expiration of the Thirteen Week Period 

Upon expiration of the one (1) year period following expiration of the thirteen (13) week period, if the Producer desires to use the Derivative New Media Production on advertiser-supported platforms, then it shall pay residuals at the rate of six percent ( $6 \%$ ) of "Distributor's gross," as that term is defined in Paragraph 5 below.

## (4) Use on Consumer Pay Platforms

For use of a Derivative New Media Production on new media platforms for which the consumer pays (e.g., download-to-own, download-to-rent, paid streaming), the Producer shall pay a residual equal to $3.6 \%$ of the "Distributor's gross," as that term is defined in Paragraph 5 below, attributable to the period beyond the twenty-six (26) week period of use.

## (5) Use in Traditional Media

The Producer shall pay residuals for the use of a Derivative New Media Production in "traditional media" (e.g., free television, basic cable, pay television, home video) as a use under existing SAG-AFTRA Network TV Code formulas.
a. Free Television Exhibition
(i) Except with respect to exhibition of dramatic Derivative New Media Productions that exceed fifteen (15) minutes in length in network prime time, residual payments for freetelevision exhibition of Derivative New Media Productions shall be computed as follows:

The new media exhibition of the Derivative New Media Production shall constitute the first run for purposes of calculating residual payments in free television. The residual payment shall be the product of the program fee for a free television program of the same category and length as the Derivative New Media Production multiplied by the percentage applicable to the replay in question.

As an example, suppose that a five (5) minute non-dramatic Derivative New Media Production is exhibited for the first time in network prime time. The applicable residual is the program fee used for a non-dramatic program five (5) minutes and under in length exhibited in syndication (\$253 as of February 27, 2012). That figure will be multiplied by $75 \%$, the percentage applicable to a second run on a network, for a total residual payment of $\$ 189$.
(ii) The formula for reruns in network prime time of dramatic Derivative New Media Productions that exceed fifteen (15) minutes in length is as follows: The new media exhibition of the Derivative New Media Production shall constitute the first run for purposes of calculating residual payments for use on free television. The residual payment shall be the applicable residual under the SAG-AFTRA Network TV Code for a rerun in network prime time of a free television program of the same type and length as the Derivative New Media Production.
b. Exhibition on Pay Television, on Home Video and on Basic Cable

For exhibition on pay television, the Producer shall pay residuals equal to $3.6 \%$ of "Distributor's gross" pursuant to Exhibit D., Section 4.B. of the SAG-AFTRA Network TV Code. For home video exploitation, the Producer shall pay residuals pursuant to Exhibit D of the SAG-AFTRA Network TV Code. For exhibition on basic cable, Producer shall pay pursuant to Exhibit D of the SAGAFTRA Network TV Code.

# B. Original New Media Productions 

The following shall apply to Original New Media Productions other than non-serial dramatic productions:
(1) What Initial Compensation Covers

Initial compensation for an Original New Media Production shall constitute payment for a twenty-six (26) week period of use on any consumer pay new media platform (hereinafter "consumer pay platform"), commencing with the first day that the Original New Media Production is available on any consumer pay platform, and all uses on free to the consumer advertisersupported platforms transmitted via New Media (hereinafter "advertisersupported platforms").
(2) Use on Consumer Pay Platforms
a. No payment shall be due for any use on consumer pay platforms for an Original New Media Production budgeted below $\$ 25,000$ per minute of actual program material as exhibited.b. For all uses of an Original New Media Production budgeted at or above $\$ 25,000$ per minute of actual program material as exhibited on consumer pay platforms (e.g., download-to-own, download-torent, paid streaming) beyond the twenty-six (26) week period, the Producer shall pay a residual equal to $3.6 \%$ of the "Distributor's gross," as that term is defined in Paragraph 5 below, attributable to the period beyond the twenty-six (26) week use period.
c. Paragraph 1 above shall apply to an Original New Media Production initially released on a consumer pay platform which is subsequently released on an advertiser-supported platform or vice versa.

# (3) Use in Traditional Media 

The Producer shall pay residuals for the use of an Original New Media Production in "traditional media" (e.g., free television, basic cable, pay television, home video) as a use under existing SAG-AFTRA TV Code formulas.

## a. Free Television Exhibition

(i) Except with respect to exhibition of serial-type dramatic Original New Media Productions that exceed fifteen (15) minutes in length in network prime time, residual payments for free television exhibition of Original New Media Productions shall be computed as follows:

The new media exhibition of the Original New Media Production shall constitute the first run for purposes of calculating residual payments in free television. The residual payment shall be the product of the program fee for a free television program of the same category and length as the original New Media Production multiplied by the percentage applicable to the replay in question.
(ii) The formula for reruns in network prime time of serial-type dramatic Original New Media Productions that exceed fifteen (15) minutes in length is as follows: The new media exhibition of the Original New Media Production shall constitute the first run for purposes of calculating residual payments for use on free television. The residual payment shall be the amount payable for a rerun in network prime time of a free television program of the same length as the Original New Media Production.
b. For exhibition on pay television, the Producer shall pay residuals equal to $3.6 \%$ of "Distributor's gross" pursuant to Exhibit D of the SAG-AFTRA Network TV Code. For home video exploitation, the Producer shall pay residuals pursuant to Exhibit D of the SAGAFTRA Network TV Code. For exhibition on basic cable, Producer shall pay pursuant to Exhibit D of the SAG-AFTRA Network TV Code.

## 5. "DISTRIBUTOR'S GROSS"

## A. Definition

The term "Distributor's gross," for purposes of all re-uses in new media of television programs made for traditional media and of Original and Derivative NewMedia Productions (each hereinafter referred to as "such Program"), as defined in Exhibit D of the SAG-AFTRA Network TV Code. ${ }^{1}$

When the "Distributor's gross" derived from new media exploitation is received from a related or affiliated entity that acts as the exhibitor/retailer of such Program, then the "Distributor's gross" received by the Producer from the licensing of such rights shall be measured by the exhibitor/retailer's payments to unrelated and unaffiliated entities in arms' length transactions for comparable programs, or, if none, then the amounts received by the Producer from unrelated and unaffiliated exhibitors/retailers in arms' length transactions for comparable programs, or, if none, a comparable exhibitor/retailer's payments to comparable unrelated and unaffiliated entities in arms' length transactions for comparable programs.

# B. Agreements and Data 

On a semi-annual basis, within ten (10) business days after such request, the Producer shall provide for inspection by SAG-AFTRA's designated employee or auditor, at Producer's premises where such data is kept, full access ${ }^{2}$ to all unredacted license, distribution, and other agreements pertaining to new media exploitation of covered programs that were entered into during the immediately preceding six months. ${ }^{3}$ In any subsequent semi-annual inspection, SAG-AFTRA's designated employee or auditor may re-inspect any agreements previously inspected and inspect any agreements not previously inspected.

Upon request, in a manner to be mutually agreed upon in good faith, the Producer shall expeditiously provide, or make available, to SAG-AFTRA data in its possession or control, or the possession or control of its related distribution entities, regarding the new media exploitation of covered programs, such as number of downloads or streams by source and ad rates.

## C. Recordkeeping and Reporting

Payment for exploitation of covered pictures in new media shall be due sixty (60) days after the end of the quarter in which the "Distributor's gross" from such exploitation is received. The Producer shall accompany such payments with reports regarding the "Distributor's gross" derived from such exploitation, which shall be specified by medium and source whenever reasonably possible and will be separated from revenues derived from exploitation of such Programs in traditional media. Along with such payments, the Producer shall provide SAG-AFTRA with unredacted copies of all corollary distributor's, sub-distributor's, and exhibitor's statements relating to the reported "Distributor's gross." SAG-AFTRA and each Producer shall discuss and agree upon a method of making this information available to SAG-AFTRA.

Where the Producer allocates revenues between new media rights and other rights in any such Program, among new media rights in multiple such Programs, or otherwise, it shall specify such allocation.

## D. Confidentiality

The information provided to SAG-AFTRA by the Producer will be treated as confidential and appropriate arrangements will be made to safeguard the confidentiality of that information.

## E. Reservation of Rights

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ For sake of clarity, "Distributor's gross" specifically includes advertising revenues when the license, distribution, or other agreement provides for sharing in such revenues.
    ${ }^{2}$ Full access includes access to all agreements, notwithstanding any confidentiality clause contained therein, and access to all sideletters, exhibits, addenda, and other ancillary documents.With respect to television programs, the Producer has agreed to a separate payment for this use on the Internet because Internet exhibition is at this time outside the primary market. The Producer reserves the right in future negotiations to contend that the pattern of release has changed so that this use constitutes or is a part of the primary market of distribution of television programs and that, therefore, no additional payment should be made with respect to the exhibition of television programs (including those covered by this Agreement) on the Internet. SAGAFTRA reserves the right in future negotiations to contend to the contrary, and further to assert that regardless of whether other exhibitions are or have become part of the primary market, residual provisions for television programs so exhibited should be improved.

# F. Other Terms and Conditions 

Except as expressly provided herein, all other terms and conditions of the SAGAFTRA TV Code, including but not limited to Paragraph 95, shall apply; in the event of a conflict, the terms and condition of this Sideletter shall control.

## 6. SUNSET CLAUSE

The parties recognize that this Sideletter is being negotiated at a time when the business models and patterns of usage of programs and other productions in new media are in the process of exploration, experimentation and innovation. Therefore, all provisions of this Sideletter expire on the termination date of the 2014 SAG-SAG-AFTRA Network TV Code and will be of no force and effect thereafter. No later than sixty (60) days before that expiration date, the parties will meet to negotiate new terms and conditions for reuse of Made for New Media Productions and television programs in new media to be in effect thereafter.

The parties further acknowledge that conditions in this area are changing rapidly and that the negotiation for the successor agreement will be based on the conditions that exist and reasonably can be forecast at that time. For example, the parties acknowledge that with respect to the formula in Paragraph 1 for the electronic sell-through of programs and television programs, the growth of electronic sell-through could adversely impact traditional home video sales. In future negotiations, the parties agree that the criteria to be considered in good faith in determining whether the electronic sell-through residual should be increased or decreased include patterns of cannibalization of the home video market and changes in the wholesale price.
7. All payments hereunder made as a percentage of "Distributor's gross" are aggregate payments for all performers who have traditionally been entitled to residuals under the SAG-AFTRA Network TV Code.

As of November 16, 2001
Re: Experiment in Syndication of Half-Hour Series in Markets Representing 50\% or
Fewer of U.S. Television Households
Reference is made to the provisions of Paragraph 73(B)(2) of the National Code of Fair Practice for Network Television Broadcasting. During the 2001 negotiations, the Producers expressed a concern that if a series could only be syndicated in markets representing fifty percent (50\%) or fewer of the U.S. television households, residuals payable pursuant to Paragraph 73(B)(2) and (3) would render such syndication fiscally untenable. The Producers asserted that the payment of any residuals in such circumstances would benefit both the Producer and the individual performers since no payments are presently made.

While AFTRA expressed concern that an accommodation might be subject to abuse or otherwise reduce overall syndication residuals, the parties agreed to an experiment for the term of this Agreement, to be reviewed by November 14, 2004 to determine its effectiveness and whether or not it should be extended. In such regard, the Producers agree to provide SAG-AFTRA with license fee information at the time of the first payment hereunder together with a detail of markets covered by the license agreement. If the series is later syndicated in additional markets, the Producer shall provide SAG-AFTRA with a detail of the additional markets at the time of the payment immediately following such later syndication.

When a half-hour series is syndicated in markets representing in the aggregate fifty percent (50\%) or fewer of U.S. television households, residuals for such series shall be payable at thirty-seven and one-half percent ( $37.5 \%$ ) of the applicable minimum program fee, but shall not constitute a "run" for purposes of Paragraph 73(B)(2) and (3).

If the series is further syndicated and the aggregate of the markets in which the series is syndicated exceeds fifty percent (50\%) of the U.S. television households, the payments required pursuant to Paragraph 73(B)(2) and (3) shall be due on any subsequent runs.

This experiment will only apply to series that have not yet been placed into syndication as of November 15, 2001.

## PRODUCER

Ladies and Gentlemen:
During the 2004-2007 negotiations, AFTRA brought to the attention of the serial Producers the concerns of serial Performers regarding negotiation of new contract terms at the expiration of a cycle during a term contract. The parties had a full discussion on the issue.

As a result of such discussions, the parties have reached an agreement to provide serial Performers a guaranteed minimum period of time for such negotiations. Accordingly, in the event that a Producer wishes to negotiate different terms of employment which could result in a reduction of guaranteed compensation at the beginning of the next cycle within a term contract already in effect (but not at the expiration of a term contract), Producer will provide notice in writing to the party(s) designated in the term contract to receive notice, with a copy to SAG-AFTRA; provided that failure to give a copy to SAG-AFTRA shall not be deemed a failure to effectuate such notice. Such notice shall be given no later than two weeks prior to the date that the cancellation notice is due.

The foregoing provision shall not preclude the parties from mutually agreeing to negotiate after notice of cancellation has been given, or when a Performer or his/her designated representative initiates a request for negotiation of the type set forth above.

The giving of such notice by Producer shall not prejudice any of the rights of the parties under a Performer's term contract or this Code.

SAG-AFTRA will not unreasonably deny a waiver to bona fide morning news programs, talk shows, magazine shows or holiday specials (e.g. Christmas in Rockefeller Center, New Year's Eve Live, Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve, Disney Park's Christmas Celebration, A Home for the Holidays, Macy's Fourth of July Spectacular) subject to the following:
(1) Members of the performance group shall be performing their own material or act, not material provided or arranged by the Producer.

The parties agree to the following for the purpose of encouraging the success of new dramatic and prime time variety free television series produced for a network or The WB. This shall also apply to Dramatic Programs and Prime Time Variety Programs on MyNetwork and to Prime Time Variety Programs on The CW. No residual compensation shall be due to series contract or term contract performers under Paragraph 73(B) or under Exhibit D for the second run (which may be either on free television or basic cable) of the first three (3) episodes broadcast (which may include the pilot) during the first production season, provided the second run occurs within a two (2) month period following the initial exhibition of each program. If such second run is on free television, it shall not constitute a "run" for purposes of Paragraph 73(B) or "release" to basic cable for purposes of Exhibit D of this Agreement. Producer shall be obligated to report any such run to SAG-AFTRA as required under this Code notwithstanding the fact that no payment shall be due therefore.

The producer may not utilize this provision at any time after the series has been cancelled.
The parties agree to study the utilization of this provision at the end of eighteen (18) months. Prior to that time, the parties will agree on the information to be exchanged as part of the study.

![img-23.jpeg](img-23.jpeg)# Re: Exhibitor / Distributor 

During the negotiation of the 2008 AFTRA Network TV Code, AFTRA and the Producers discussed the nature of distribution via new media. In particular, the Producers compared new media to basic cable distribution. The Producers stressed that a new media exhibitor might work with a third party in the same way that a cable network, such as FX, works with MSO's to exhibit programs. AFTRA acknowledged that it considers new media exhibitors such as hulu.com to be exhibitors, and not distributors, and that situations analogous to the one in basic cable would be treated the same-namely, that the third party would be considered an exhibitor and would not make the initial exhibitor a distributor.

In addition, the parties agree that language in Paragraph 1 of the Sideletter 30, which was changed in the 2008 negotiations, is not a substantive change from the corresponding language that appeared in the same Sideletter in the 2004 TV Code.

During the lengthy discussions during the 2008 negotiations over Made-for New Media Projects, AFTRA expressed the concern of its members that the Producers might use Experimental New Media Projects to circumvent the terms and conditions of the AFTRA TV Code. The Producers assured AFTRA that they do not intend to use such projects as a subterfuge to allow the production of broadcast television programs outside the terms of the AFTRA or SAG-AFTRA TV Code.

During the 2008 Code negotiations, the Producers reconfirmed their commitment to serial performers to give good faith consideration to requests for vacation. Additionally, during negotiations, performers emphasized the importance of performers' ability to attend significant family-related events such as weddings and graduations and Producers stated that they will use good faith to accommodate such requests.

Upon request from SAG-AFTRA, the serial Producers will meet with SAG-AFTRA on a Producer-by-Producer basis to discuss any problems or concerns about such vacation requests.

During the 2014 negotiations, the parties discussed the residual formula for exhibition of television programs on certain secondary digital channels. The parties agreed that instead of a fixed residual formula, Producer shall pay to the Union for ratable distribution to the performers a percentage residual formula of three and six tenths percent ( $3.6 \%$ ) of distributor's gross receipts (as defined in Exhibit D of the Network TV Code) for any license to a secondary digital channel of any free television or basic cable program and six percent ( $6 \%$ ) for any pay television program as to which a fixed residual would otherwise be payable that (i) has been out of production for at least three years and (ii) has not been exhibited under a fixed residual formula in syndication (except in the non-lead market) or pay television for at least three years in the case of a free television or pay television program or has not been exhibited under a fixed residual-formula in syndication (except in the non-lead market), pay television or basic cable for at least three years in the case of a basic cable program. However, for any free television series consisting of sixty-eight (68) or fewer episodes or any basic cable or pay television series consisting of forty (40) or fewer episodes, the series need only have been out of production for at least two years and not been exhibited under a fixed residual formula on basic cable, pay or free television (except syndication in the non-lead market) for at least one year. AFTRA Health \& Retirement contributions shall be made in addition to the percentage payments made on pay television programs hereunder regardless of the date produced and on free television and basic cable programs produced on or after November 16, 1973, and the percentage payments shall be inclusive of Health and Retirement for free television and basic cable programs produced prior to November 16, 1973.

When the 'Distributor's gross receipts' derived from such license(s) are received from a related or affiliated entity that acts as the exhibitor of the program, then the 'Distributor's gross receipts' received by the Producer from the licensing of such rights shall be measured by the exhibitor's payments to unrelated and unaffiliated entities in arms' length transactions for comparable programs or series, or, if none, then the amounts received by the Producer from unrelated and unaffiliated exhibitors in arms' length transactions for comparable programs or series, or, if none, comparable exhibitor's payments to comparable unrelated and unaffiliated entities in arms' length transactions for comparable programs or series.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the minimum payment pursuant to this provision for any program licensed to a related or affiliated entity shall be an aggregate amount for all performers of $\$ 150$ for a 30 -minute program, $\$ 300$ for a 60 -minute program $\$ 450$ for a 90 -minute program, and $\$ 600$ for a 120 -minute program.

The 'pro rata' share payable to each performer on a pay television program shall be distributed on the basis of time and salary units pursuant to Exhibit E of the Network Television Code. The 'pro rata' share payable to performers on non-serial dramatic programs produced on or after November 16, 2014 shall be distributed on the basis of 3-2-1. The 'pro rata' share payable to each performer on any other free television or basic cable program shall be distributed on the basis of a two-to-one ratio for principal performers against other performers. The pro rata share shall be limited to one and five tenths percent ( $1.5 \%$ ) where the off camera announcer is the only covered performer.

The foregoing applies to free television, pay television or basic cable programs as to which a free television residual would otherwise be payable, whether produced under an agreement with SAG-AFTRA negotiated after November 16, 2014 or under any agreement with SAG, AFTRA or SAG-AFTRA negotiated prior to November 16, 2014.SCREEN ACTORS GUILD - AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TELEVISION AND RADIO ARTISTS

If Producer licenses a non-Exhibit A program (including a program or series made for basic cable, but excluding any program or series made for syndication) for exhibition in syndication only in Canada, and residuals would otherwise be payable for that exhibition, it shall have the option to pay to the Union, for rateable distribution to the performers, seven and two-tenths percent (7.2\%) (twelve percent ( $12 \%$ ) for pay television) plus AFTRA Health \& Retirement contributions, of distributor's gross receipts (as defined in Exhibit D of the Network TV Code) derived therefrom, in lieu of any other compensation required under this Agreement or any prior Agreement, as applicable, and such exhibition shall not count as a 'run' for purposes of calculating residuals. The foregoing applies to television programs as to which free television residuals would otherwise be payable, whether produced under an agreement with SAG-AFTRA negotiated after November 16, 2014 or under any agreement with SAG, AFTRA or SAG-AFTRA negotiated prior to November $16,2014$.

The parties agree that with respect to 'High Budget' Dramatic Original or Derivative Programs produced for initial exhibition on subscription video-on-demand consumer pay platforms ("High Budget SVOD Programs"), as defined in Sideletter H of the 2014-2017 SAGAFTRA Television Agreement ("TV Agreement"), the Producer shall, except as provided below, produce such programs incorporating the terms and conditions set forth in Paragraph E. of that Sideletter, but shall not otherwise be deemed a signatory to the TV Agreement. A Producer who is a party to the AFTRA Health and Retirement Funds and has not made contributions to the SAG Pension and Health Plans during the period January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2014 shall not be required to contribute to the SAG Plans for such High Budget SVOD Programs, unless the Producer elects otherwise, and may make contributions instead to the AFTRA Health and Retirement Funds. Further, a Producer shall make contributions with respect to performers employed on High Budget Derivative SVOD Programs to the same Plans or Funds to which contributions are or were made for performers employed on the Original Television Program on which the High Budget Derivative SVOD Program is based.

During the course of negotiations for the successor to 2011-2014 Network TV Code ("Code"), the parties discussed the applicability of Sideletter 29 with regard to Original or Derivative serial dramatic programs made for High Budget SVOD. While dramatic serial production is covered by Sideletter 29, the parties acknowledged the difficulty in distinguishing serial dramatic programs made for SVOD from other dramatic programs made for SVOD. The hallmarks of serials, as that term is understood under the Code, as distinguished from other dramatic programs, include but are not limited to the multiplicity of episodes, their exhibition pattern, and very long story arcs, such as are in "General Hospital,", "The Young And The Restless," "The Bold And The Beautiful," and "Days Of Our Lives." The parties recognize that there are currently no known serials made for High Budget SVOD. The parties agree that if during the term of the successor to the 2011-2014 Code, a Producer commences production of a High Budget SVOD Serial as described, the terms and conditions of Sideletter H of the TV Agreement do not automatically apply. Rather, the parties agree to meet to discuss the appropriate terms and conditions of employment for covered performers on such productions.

CPT Holdings, Inc.Dear [Hiring Executive]:
The Union has made proposals to restrict the employment as performers of active members of the Producer's casting or production staffs, and their friends and relatives, who are not professional performers. The Union maintained that these non-professional individuals substitute for, replace and reduce employment opportunities in all performance categories ("principals," "under -5s," background actors) which are an integral and vital segment of the professional performers' talent pool.

The Union reiterates that (1) too often the hiring of these non-professional performers is done to bestow economic favors rather than for creative reasons; (2) many of these nonprofessional performers do not intend to become professional performers; and (3) the foregoing represents both an unfair treatment of professional performers and an unwarranted drain upon the economic resources of the AFTRA Health and Retirement Funds.

Without in any way commenting upon the merits of the Union's allegations, the industry does acknowledge the gravity with which the Union addresses this issue, and agrees that professional performers represent a talent pool of considerable importance to the industry's well being.

In addition, and with specific reference to SAG-AFTRA's assertion that some Producers hire non-professional performers for the sole purpose of enabling such non-professionals to earn the minimum required to qualify for coverage under the AFTRA Health and Retirement Plans, the industry joins SAG-AFTRA in censuring any Producer who does engage in such practice.

Therefore, the Producers have agreed to circulate this statement to their hiring executives on an annual basis.

Sincerely,
[Company]# Dear [Casting Director]: 

When engaged by this Company, casting directors will adhere to the following Company policy:
(1) A casting director shall not attend or lend his/her name to any acting school, workshop, seminar or like programs which promises a performer a guarantee of employment in exchange for his/her attendance at such program.
(2) A casting director shall not attend or lend his/her name to any acting school, workshop, seminar or like programs which advertises the specific role(s) or motion picture(s) for which the casting director is currently casting.
(3) A casting director is prohibited from accepting any fee from a performer in exchange for selection for a specific role or for viewing a performer's showcase performance.
(4) Casting directors will continue to seek out performers through methods such as granting interviews, accepting submissions from acting schools, attending showcases and utilizing SAG-AFTRA resources.
